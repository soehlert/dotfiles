2014-07-17 10:57:32	WeeJay	yo! i installed bro at home last night and lot of useful information has come to light just from the connection summary emails
2014-07-17 10:57:50	WeeJay	do you guys do any trending based on these connection summary output?
2014-07-17 11:12:38	soehlert_	nah we generally dont care much about the connection summary stuff.
2014-07-17 11:12:38	soehlert_	we do a little bit with similar info in splunk i guess
2014-07-17 11:39:59	WeeJay	the connection summary can be a great way to establish baseline at least in my small network
2014-07-17 11:40:15	WeeJay	but that means i must get the data charted
2014-07-17 11:40:36	WeeJay	right now i am gettign these summaries hourly and i need to change it to daily
2014-07-17 11:56:29	soehlert_	i think theres a setting in your local.bro file to fix that
2014-07-17 11:59:07	WeeJay	LogRotationInterval
2014-07-17 11:59:19	WeeJay	i chagned it and restarted bro but i must not have done it right last night
2014-07-17 12:01:14	soehlert_	broctl install; broctl check; broctl restart
2014-07-17 12:01:20	WeeJay	strange when i modify the local.bro and stop/start using broctl, that config output still shows the loginterval to 60 mins
2014-07-17 12:01:32	soehlert_	because you didnt do a broctl install
2014-07-17 12:01:43	WeeJay	i thought i only had to do that the first time
2014-07-17 12:01:51	WeeJay	so i need to do it each time i modify the config?
2014-07-17 12:02:02	soehlert_	nope that installs any config changes.
2014-07-17 12:02:26	WeeJay	ok i just did stop and install and no dice
2014-07-17 12:02:31	WeeJay	still showing 60 mins
2014-07-17 12:02:43	soehlert_	broctl install; broctl check; broctl restart
2014-07-17 12:02:49	soehlert_	literally copypasta that
2014-07-17 12:02:52	WeeJay	ah! i had to quit the broctl and enter it again
2014-07-17 12:03:04	WeeJay	i was doing the install and restart from the same broctl shell
2014-07-17 12:03:10	soehlert_	if you enter it like i did you dont have to go into the broctl shell
2014-07-17 12:03:53	WeeJay	makes sense. he if i am running standalone mode, does it need to listen on a tcp port?
2014-07-17 12:03:59	WeeJay	can't it just use a socket
2014-07-17 12:05:15	soehlert_	not sure. never used standalone mode
2014-07-17 12:05:32	WeeJay	:D you so badass
2014-07-17 12:05:44	WeeJay	trying to find documentation which exaplains each config option
2014-07-17 12:05:45	soehlert_	we just have lots of hardware
2014-07-17 12:05:56	soehlert_	ask jerknette that's basically her job
2014-07-17 12:07:23	WeeJay	wtf there are no man pages
2014-07-17 12:07:36	soehlert_	nah thatd be insanely large
2014-07-17 12:07:40	WeeJay	how do you figure out what each config does?  their side does not have documentation either
2014-07-17 12:07:56	soehlert_	ya it does you are bad at searching :) give me a second
2014-07-17 12:08:26	WeeJay	http://www.bro.org/documentation/index.html#documentation

2014-07-17 12:11:43	WeeJay	it seems you are also having trouble with it :D
2014-07-17 12:16:00	soehlert_	nahh i just have boss in here talking to me. delegated to jerknette. 
2014-07-17 12:16:16	WeeJay	nice..i knew you were cut out for management

2014-07-17 12:21:55	WeeJay	i was trying to figure out what ipv6off did and noticed i couldn't find any info anywhere for most of the options
2014-07-17 12:21:59	soehlert_	didnt think so but just watned to verify before i make her go do stuff
2014-07-17 12:22:10	WeeJay	includeing their index http://www.bro.org/sphinx/genindex.html

2014-07-17 12:28:44	WeeJay	fu
2014-07-17 12:29:07	soehlert_	thats broctl not local.bro
2014-07-17 12:29:16	soehlert_	i coulda given you that ages ago
2014-07-17 12:30:10	WeeJay	the internal options...aren't those same as what you would put in local.bro?
2014-07-17 12:30:47	soehlert_	no those are broctl.cfg options
2014-07-17 12:31:24	WeeJay	ah! i miscommunicated.  I was looking for those options.  regardless that documentation is incomplete as it leaves out many options
2014-07-17 12:31:34	soehlert_	ah. well. i blame you then
