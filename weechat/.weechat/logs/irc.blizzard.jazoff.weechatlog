2014-04-16 13:01:25	jazoff	hi
2014-04-16 13:01:27	jazoff	oh, derr
2014-04-16 13:01:48	jazoff	http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/1014#note-6
2014-04-16 13:02:03	soehlert	howd you create the new buffer? when i did msg it just went into the weechat buffer
2014-04-16 13:04:41	jazoff	oh weird
2014-04-16 13:04:47	jazoff	I wonder if I have autoquery oromething
2014-04-16 13:04:50	jazoff	will check and get back to you
2014-04-16 13:04:53	soehlert	k
2014-05-22 13:42:55	jazoff	ready
2014-05-22 13:46:37	soehlert	ok so i thought you said it wasn't the best practice to use global variables
2014-05-22 13:46:51	jazoff	those are acting as constants
2014-05-22 13:46:56	jazoff	using global variables for mutable state = bad
2014-05-22 13:47:06	soehlert	ah but global constants are ok
2014-05-22 13:47:10	jazoff	yeah
2014-05-22 13:47:16	jazoff	as long as they are constants, which I think they are?
2014-05-22 13:47:24	soehlert	ya file names shouldnt change
2014-05-22 13:47:55	soehlert	so then the next big thing is: get_date.name = "date"                                                                                                                    │        exit 1
2014-05-22 13:48:02	soehlert	weird copy...ignore the exit 1 stuff
2014-05-22 13:48:19	jazoff	ah yeah, that's just setting an attribute on the function so I can use it later
2014-05-22 13:48:26	jazoff	but I realized those are not neede
2014-05-22 13:48:54	soehlert	why are they not needed? already returning the necessary parts?
2014-05-22 13:49:41	jazoff	just pushed the change removing them
2014-05-22 13:49:51	jazoff	see the end of the script
2014-05-22 13:50:00	jazoff	        res = run(func)
2014-05-22 13:50:00	jazoff	        report[name] = res
2014-05-22 13:50:28	soehlert	ya not familiar with run()
2014-05-22 13:50:31	soehlert	whats that do?
2014-05-22 13:52:41	jazoff	look 2 lines up
2014-05-22 13:53:25	soehlert	is that just a way to call the function? two lines up just says print name
2014-05-22 13:54:11	jazoff	oh er
2014-05-22 13:54:26	jazoff	10 lines up :)
2014-05-22 13:54:52	soehlert	oh hah you created that function..
2014-05-22 13:55:06	soehlert	i dont understand it really at all though. 
2014-05-22 13:55:06	soehlert	havent learned error handling yet
2014-05-22 13:55:32	soehlert	is that basically just going to run that function unless it has an IOError?
2014-05-22 13:55:39	jazoff	yeah
2014-05-22 13:55:59	soehlert	and set whatever the function returns to be res?
2014-05-22 13:56:29	jazoff	yeah
2014-05-22 13:56:38	jazoff	res = run(func) is pretty much the same as res=func()
2014-05-22 13:56:43	jazoff	just ignoring files not existing
2014-05-22 13:57:48	soehlert	oh so your IOError is taking care of all my checking if the file exists first stuff? i knew there had to be a better way
2014-05-22 13:59:44	jazoff	exactly
2014-05-22 14:00:22	soehlert	ok and why do you do res = run(func) followed up with report[name] = res
2014-05-22 14:00:34	soehlert	why not just report[name] = run(func)
2014-05-22 14:00:43	jazoff	same thing
2014-05-22 14:00:47	jazoff	no reason I guess
2014-05-22 14:00:59	soehlert	ok i knew they were the same just wondering if there was a specific reason
2014-05-22 14:01:02	jazoff	i think I had somethign else in there that I removed
2014-05-22 14:01:11	soehlert	ah ok
2014-05-22 14:01:58	soehlert	so you're setting the name for each function here right? name = func.__name__.replace("get_", "").replace("_", " ")
2014-05-22 14:02:09	soehlert	instead of doing that get_date.name = "date" thing right?
2014-05-22 14:02:17	jazoff	yeah
2014-05-22 14:02:24	jazoff	func.__name__ is the literal function name
2014-05-22 14:02:29	jazoff	which is moooostly what I want
2014-05-22 14:02:41	jazoff	so I just replace things a bit and then it comes out the same as before
2014-05-22 14:02:41	soehlert	what's with the __name__ part
2014-05-22 14:02:56	jazoff	>>> def foo(): pass
2014-05-22 14:02:56	jazoff	...
2014-05-22 14:02:56	jazoff	>>> foo.__name__
2014-05-22 14:02:57	jazoff	'foo'
2014-05-22 14:03:05	soehlert	ahhh just a built in
2014-05-22 14:03:23	soehlert	method?
2014-05-22 14:04:36	jazoff	attribute
2014-05-22 14:04:46	soehlert	ok
2014-05-22 14:05:03	jazoff	>>> def foo(): pass
2014-05-22 14:05:04	jazoff	...
2014-05-22 14:05:04	jazoff	>>> dir(foo)
2014-05-22 14:05:04	jazoff	['__call__', '__class__', '__closure__', '__code__', '__defaults__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__', '__format__', '__get__', '__getattribute__', '__globals__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__module__', '__name__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'func_closure', 'func_code', 'func_defaults', 'func_dict', 'func_doc', 'func_globals', 'func_name']
2014-05-22 14:05:29	soehlert	whats the difference between func_name and __name__?
2014-05-22 14:05:36	jazoff	hmm
2014-05-22 14:05:49	jazoff	nothing
2014-05-22 14:05:54	soehlert	fair enough
2014-05-22 14:05:56	jazoff	one is probably better to use
2014-05-22 14:06:27	soehlert	why are you doing this in tcpwrappers still? if not os.path.isfile(hosts_allow):
2014-05-22 14:06:36	jazoff	forgot to remove :)
2014-05-22 14:06:40	soehlert	ah ok
2014-05-22 14:06:44	soehlert	that makes more sense hah
2014-05-22 14:06:56	jazoff	ah, and I didn't add it to the list so it's not even being ran
2014-05-22 14:07:12	soehlert	thats cool it wasn't working yet when i left it off...not sure hwy not
2014-05-22 14:07:45	jazoff	ah
2014-05-22 14:07:53	jazoff	it wasn't being called before either
2014-05-22 14:09:18	soehlert	oh haha. thta explains it. i was gonna say i think the logic is right..
2014-05-22 14:11:28	soehlert	so how come you created a main() instead of calling them under the if __name__ thing like i had?
2014-05-22 14:11:32	soehlert	just more pythonic?
2014-05-22 14:11:51	jazoff	it's nice to have a function at some point
2014-05-22 14:12:18	soehlert	fair enough. why is the data_sources list not in the main() function?
2014-05-22 14:12:36	jazoff	doesn't need to be.
2014-05-22 14:12:47	jazoff	also, just though of a way that the vetting stuff could work slightly differently
2014-05-22 14:12:52	soehlert	?
2014-05-22 14:12:53	jazoff	still use a .sh script but do stuff like
2014-05-22 14:13:02	jazoff	iptables > iptables.txt
2014-05-22 14:13:15	jazoff	grep root /etc/group > group.txt
2014-05-22 14:13:16	jazoff	etc
2014-05-22 14:13:23	jazoff	then tar up the .txt files and ftp that
2014-05-22 14:13:36	jazoff	then all the parsing etc is done remotely but the vetted system just needs sh and tar
2014-05-22 14:15:04	soehlert	that might be a better move. since i was having a hard time figuring out how to do some of this stuff in python
2014-05-22 14:19:07	soehlert	looks like SuSE has tar as does rhel/centos. im presuming ubuntu/debian has it as well?
2014-05-22 14:22:33	soehlert	so basically scrap this script, fix up the .sh to output to individual files and tar that?
2014-05-22 14:22:47	jazoff	yeah, everything should have tar
2014-05-22 14:22:52	jazoff	and not such much scrap this script
2014-05-22 14:23:26	jazoff	just rather than opening /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward you could just open ip_forward.txt
2014-05-22 14:24:06	soehlert	thats true. would it make sense to just create a read_file() function and then in the ip_forwarding() you would just pass a file name to the read_file function?
2014-05-22 14:24:16	soehlert	and so on for all the others as well..
2014-05-22 14:24:29	jazoff	yeah.. something like that
2014-05-22 14:24:37	jazoff	hard to plan ahead that sort of thing sometimes
2014-05-22 14:24:55	jazoff	i usually just start by donig the simplest thing and if it gets repetetive, refactor
2014-05-22 14:25:16	soehlert	true. just seems there should be some way functionize that as all the sections are just going to be reading a file and pumping that info into something
2014-05-22 14:26:14	jazoff	yep
2014-05-22 14:27:20	soehlert	ok well while we are talking about this stuff...and since it will probably come into play again...can you explain this part
2014-05-22 14:27:22	soehlert	    fn = "%s-%s.json" % (report["hostname"], report["date"])
2014-05-22 14:27:22	soehlert	    with open(fn, 'w') as f:
2014-05-22 14:27:22	soehlert	        json.dump(report, f)
2014-05-22 14:27:22	soehlert	        f.write("\n")
2014-05-22 14:27:38	soehlert	the report[] stuff i guess is really the confusing part
2014-05-22 14:27:43	jazoff	fn = "%s-%s.json" % (report["hostname"], report["date"]) just formats the filename
2014-05-22 14:27:48	soehlert	is that a variable? 
2014-05-22 14:27:57	soehlert	right i get what its doing just dont know the report stuff
2014-05-22 14:27:58	jazoff	"%(hostname)s-%(data)s" % report  would have worekd too
2014-05-22 14:28:11	jazoff	report is just the output from all the functions
2014-05-22 14:28:28	soehlert	but what is report[]? a list and you're looking for the hostname or date output?
2014-05-22 14:29:13	jazoff	    report = {}
2014-05-22 14:29:27	soehlert	oh hell. didnt see that. so its a dict
2014-05-22 14:29:36	soehlert	and youre calling the hostname and date keys
2014-05-22 14:29:44	jazoff	accessing
2014-05-22 14:29:55	soehlert	right accessing...calling is not the right word
2014-05-22 14:30:49	soehlert	ok and i think last question. its gonna be a dumb one. 
2014-05-22 14:31:27	soehlert	i dont fully understand how to know where to indent the returns to in my functions. obviously outside of loops because otherwise it would change everytime. but how do i know where to indent it to?
2014-05-22 14:31:50	jazoff	return ends the function
2014-05-22 14:31:55	jazoff	so you return when you are done
2014-05-22 14:32:31	soehlert	right i know that, but i mean as far as indentation. compare ipforwarding() to securit_access
2014-05-22 14:32:52	soehlert	ipforwarding has it equally indented to with while seuciryt_access has it indented equal to the for
2014-05-22 14:33:53	jazoff	ok, so take a function like this (stupid function)
2014-05-22 14:34:26	jazoff	def is_in_list(lst, item):
2014-05-22 14:34:27	jazoff	    for x in lst:
2014-05-22 14:34:27	jazoff	        if x == item:
2014-05-22 14:34:27	jazoff	            return True
2014-05-22 14:34:27	jazoff	    return False
2014-05-22 14:35:04	soehlert	ok
2014-05-22 14:35:34	soehlert	isnt that going to always return false after it runs through the whole lst?
2014-05-22 14:35:45	jazoff	how so?
2014-05-22 14:36:37	soehlert	idk. so its going to look at each item in the list and compare that to item...return true if its equal.
2014-05-22 14:36:37	soehlert	i guess i dont see when the return false would come up
2014-05-22 14:37:02	jazoff	if it's not found
2014-05-22 14:37:50	soehlert	so why not...
2014-05-22 14:37:50	soehlert	if x == item: return true
2014-05-22 14:37:50	soehlert	else: return false
2014-05-22 14:38:04	jazoff	what would it do on the first item?
2014-05-22 14:39:01	soehlert	im assuming it wont work, but i dont see why not. does the function end if you return false or something?
2014-05-22 14:39:18	jazoff	yes
2014-05-22 14:39:38	soehlert	ahhh
2014-05-22 14:39:38	soehlert	so it finds all the true ones first then goes to the return false after?
2014-05-22 14:39:41	soehlert	doing it your way
2014-05-22 14:39:53	jazoff	no, it would find ANY true one
2014-05-22 14:40:35	soehlert	oh right. return ends the function so it would also stop on the first return true right?
2014-05-22 14:40:46	jazoff	yes
2014-05-22 14:41:16	soehlert	so the first might not be true, but we can't have the else otherwise it wouldnt keep checking. then it keeps checking and if it finds nothing it returns false
2014-05-22 14:41:46	jazoff	yep
2014-05-22 14:42:52	soehlert	so theoretically then, looking at security_access, could you move it over one tab and it would still work the same?
2014-05-22 14:43:48	soehlert	one tab to the left that is
2014-05-22 14:44:09	soehlert	and ipforwarding could be moved one tab to the right and it would still work?
2014-05-22 14:45:09	jazoff	hmm
2014-05-22 14:45:26	jazoff	yeah, in security access it doesn't matter
2014-05-22 14:45:59	jazoff	but that's mostly due to it not mattering because of the with
2014-05-22 14:46:12	jazoff	last statement inside the with block vs last statement in the function.. same thing
2014-05-22 14:46:18	soehlert	ya thats basically what i was seeing
2014-05-22 14:46:35	soehlert	which is why you can move it over one to the right in the ipforwarding fucntion as well
2014-05-22 14:46:48	soehlert	and why i was getting confused, since it doesnt' totally matter
2014-05-22 14:47:35	jazoff	a for loop is completely different though
2014-05-22 14:47:52	soehlert	absolutely. i get that part
2014-05-22 14:47:52	soehlert	it was mostly how many outside of the for loop do i need it
2014-05-22 14:48:03	soehlert	how many tabs*
2014-05-22 14:48:09	jazoff	it depeneds if you are trying to do an early return or not
2014-05-22 14:48:21	jazoff	if it's something you can return true/false ASAP, you have it inside the loop
2014-05-22 14:48:31	jazoff	if you have to wait until the end of the loop, well then it has to go after it ends
2014-05-22 14:48:38	soehlert	right. 
2014-05-22 14:48:49	jazoff	for that is_in_list you can return True as soon as you find it once
2014-05-22 14:48:56	jazoff	but you need to go all the way through before you can return False
2014-05-22 14:49:07	soehlert	exactly what i was just typing out. cool i think im getting it
2014-05-22 14:51:38	soehlert	thanks for the help. ill get to work on the sh script
2014-05-22 14:57:40	jazoff	:)
2014-05-23 02:41:56	--	irc: disconnected from server
2014-06-06 01:54:50	--	irc: disconnected from server
2014-06-13 01:54:48	--	irc: disconnected from server
2014-06-13 11:59:34	soehlert	quicky python question for you..
2014-06-13 12:00:24	soehlert	trying to compare a variable in a for loop against the last element of a list and make sure the merged variable is false
2014-06-13 12:00:30	soehlert	does this work? elif tile == result[-1] and not merged
2014-06-13 12:00:42	jazoff	yeah
2014-06-13 12:00:55	jazoff	as long as result is not empty
2014-06-13 12:01:09	soehlert	ooo it might be the first run..hmm
2014-06-13 12:01:49	jazoff	just add a
2014-06-13 12:01:51	jazoff	results and ...
2014-06-13 12:02:18	soehlert	elif results and tile == result[-1] and not merged:
2014-06-13 12:04:26	jazoff	yeah
2014-06-13 12:04:33	jazoff	er, result though
2014-06-13 12:05:16	soehlert	right
2014-06-13 12:06:54	soehlert	actually i think i don't need that as i can initialize the list like so: result = [0 for dummy_i in range(len(line))]
2014-06-13 12:07:22	soehlert	basically for this class we're building a copy of the game 2048. so we get an input line and i'm working on taking that line and merging it 
2014-06-13 12:11:28	jazoff	[0 for _ in line]
2014-06-13 12:11:46	jazoff	or [0] * len(line)
2014-06-13 12:28:34	jazoff	walk, brb
2014-06-13 13:04:15	soehlert	hey how do you return two things in python?
2014-06-13 13:04:22	jazoff	return thing1, thing2
2014-06-13 13:04:22	soehlert	def __init__(self, grid_height, grid_width):
2014-06-13 13:04:22	soehlert	        # replace with your code
2014-06-13 13:04:22	soehlert	        self.grid_height = grid_height
2014-06-13 13:04:22	soehlert	        self.grid_width = grid_width
2014-06-13 13:04:22	soehlert	        reset
2014-06-13 13:04:22	soehlert	        return self.grid_height, self.grid_width
2014-06-13 13:04:41	jazoff	__init__ does not return anything
2014-06-13 13:04:41	soehlert	i imagine i want to return a tuple?
2014-06-13 13:04:48	jazoff	and that reset doesn't do anything either
2014-06-13 13:04:59	soehlert	well ya sorry reset is actually another function they gave us
2014-06-13 13:05:14	soehlert	but how do i access grid_height and grid_width from other methods if i dont return them?
2014-06-13 13:05:22	soehlert	this is all inside the same class btw
2014-06-13 13:06:15	jazoff	just like you do there
2014-06-13 13:06:17	jazoff	self.grid_width
2014-06-13 13:06:39	soehlert	oh ok i don't have to return them there. got it
2014-06-13 13:06:46	jazoff	you can't return them there
2014-06-13 13:07:20	soehlert	so you never return anything in init then?
2014-06-13 13:09:27	jazoff	no
2014-06-13 13:10:19	soehlert	fair enough. classes are still a bit confusing to me, but that should help a little actually
2014-06-13 13:13:59	jazoff	they are just containers for self
2014-06-13 13:14:08	jazoff	where you stick the stuff you want to work on
2014-06-13 13:47:37	soehlert	ok im trying to print out a string representation of my board.
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	    def __str__(self):
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	        """
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	        Return a string representation of the grid for debugging.
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	        """
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	        # replace with your code
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	        grid_str = ""
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	        for i in range(self.grid_height):
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	            for j in range(self.grid_width):
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	                grid_str = ', '.join(map(str, self.grid[i][j]))
2014-06-13 13:47:40	soehlert	        return grid_str
2014-06-13 13:48:00	soehlert	so basically i should be getting a 4x4 grid of 0's
2014-06-13 13:48:46	soehlert	if i do: grid_str = ', '.join(map(str, self.grid[i])), then i get one row of 4 0's, but if i do it as the way i have with the j in there, i get an error: "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable"
2014-06-13 13:55:21	jazoff	well yeah, you are calling like
2014-06-13 13:55:29	jazoff	', '.join(map(str, 1024))
2014-06-13 13:56:39	jazoff	you want to join the columns together with , to get the rows
2014-06-13 13:56:46	jazoff	then join the rows together with \n to get the full grid
2014-06-13 14:06:34	jazoff	just figure out how to get a list of the row strings first
2014-06-13 14:09:45	soehlert	so it seems i'm sorta on the right track at first glance, but it would seem these are treated as individual strings still..
2014-06-13 14:09:48	soehlert	        for row in range(self.grid_height):
2014-06-13 14:09:48	soehlert	            for col in range(self.grid_width):
2014-06-13 14:09:48	soehlert	                col_str = ', '.join(map(str, self.grid[col]))
2014-06-13 14:09:48	soehlert	            return col_str
2014-06-13 14:10:31	soehlert	col_str prints out as 0, 0, 0, 0 but it seems they aren't one long string..
2014-06-13 14:11:21	jazoff	ook.. start over
2014-06-13 14:11:27	jazoff	self.grid[0] is what?
2014-06-13 14:12:05	jazoff	if you do
2014-06-13 14:12:08	jazoff	for x in self.grid:
2014-06-13 14:12:09	jazoff	   print x
2014-06-13 14:12:10	jazoff	what do you get
2014-06-13 14:13:19	soehlert	self.grid[0] is the first row of 0s
2014-06-13 14:14:04	soehlert	so if you did your for loop it would be all of the 0s
2014-06-13 14:14:11	soehlert	or all of the rows i should say
2014-06-13 14:14:25	jazoff	so in that for loop, x is what?
2014-06-13 14:14:41	soehlert	the index number of the row from the self.grid list
2014-06-13 14:14:51	jazoff	did you run that code ?
2014-06-13 14:15:03	soehlert	no ill go try it
2014-06-13 14:15:48	soehlert	x isnt the index number, it's the actual row.
2014-06-13 14:15:54	soehlert	in list form
2014-06-13 14:16:41	jazoff	so
2014-06-13 14:16:45	jazoff	for row in self.grid:
2014-06-13 14:16:46	jazoff	   print row
2014-06-13 14:16:51	jazoff	makes more sense
2014-06-13 14:16:55	soehlert	yes
2014-06-13 14:17:02	jazoff	ok, now, what is row?
2014-06-13 14:17:12	soehlert	as in what type?
2014-06-13 14:17:14	jazoff	yeah
2014-06-13 14:17:19	soehlert	a list
2014-06-13 14:18:02	soehlert	print type(row) says so, so now im confident in that
2014-06-13 14:18:11	jazoff	so how do you get from row, to a string representing that row
2014-06-13 14:18:33	soehlert	iterate over that row and join the pieces into a string?
2014-06-13 14:18:46	jazoff	row = [0, 0, 0]
2014-06-13 14:18:50	jazoff	row_str = ???
2014-06-13 14:18:59	jazoff	what's the exact line you need?
2014-06-13 14:19:10	soehlert	row_str = "row"
2014-06-13 14:19:18	jazoff	lol no
2014-06-13 14:19:19	soehlert	no thats not right..
2014-06-13 14:19:26	jazoff	you kind of have it above
2014-06-13 14:19:49	soehlert	row_str = str(row)
2014-06-13 14:20:01	jazoff	no.. that doesn't give you the format you want
2014-06-13 14:26:42	soehlert	do i want to iterate over the row and str each entry? then join them together to form the row in string form?
2014-06-13 14:27:11	jazoff	yes.. you have that above
2014-06-13 14:27:18	jazoff	just calling it with the wrong thing
2014-06-13 14:30:09	soehlert	        for row in self.grid:
2014-06-13 14:30:09	soehlert	            for entry in row:
2014-06-13 14:30:09	soehlert	                entry_str = str(entry)
2014-06-13 14:30:35	jazoff	... but you had what you needed above
2014-06-13 14:30:40	jazoff	where did you get the join and map thing?
2014-06-13 14:30:53	soehlert	oh ya i was going to do that on the next line..
2014-06-13 14:30:59	soehlert	row_str = ', '.join(map(str, entry_str))
2014-06-13 14:31:33	soehlert	so i guess in total i have: 
2014-06-13 14:31:35	soehlert	        for row in self.grid:
2014-06-13 14:31:35	soehlert	            for entry in row:
2014-06-13 14:31:35	soehlert	                entry_str = str(entry)
2014-06-13 14:31:35	soehlert	                row_str = ', '.join(map(str, entry_str))
2014-06-13 14:31:47	jazoff	noooo
2014-06-13 14:31:50	jazoff	what does map do?
2014-06-13 14:31:52	soehlert	crap.
2014-06-13 14:32:16	jazoff	making it way too complicated
2014-06-13 14:32:28	soehlert	Finally, you may use map() to convert each item in the list to a string, and then join them:
2014-06-13 14:32:28	soehlert	>>> print ', '.join(map(str, list_of_ints))
2014-06-13 14:32:28	soehlert	i know i am. theres no way its this tough.
2014-06-13 14:32:41	jazoff	what kind of variable is row?
2014-06-13 14:32:58	soehlert	row is a list of int. so i dont need to do the entry stuff.
2014-06-13 14:33:18	jazoff	.. :)
2014-06-13 14:33:39	soehlert	        for row in self.grid:
2014-06-13 14:33:39	soehlert	            row_str = ', '.join(map(str, row))
2014-06-13 14:34:02	soehlert	so now i have a string of one row
2014-06-13 14:35:07	jazoff	right
2014-06-13 14:35:18	jazoff	so you just need to get a list of strings of rows
2014-06-13 14:44:11	soehlert	        row_lst = []
2014-06-13 14:44:11	soehlert	        for row in self.grid:
2014-06-13 14:44:11	soehlert	            row_str = ', '.join(map(str, row)) 
2014-06-13 14:44:11	soehlert	            row_lst.append(row_str)
2014-06-13 14:44:11	soehlert	        print row_lst
2014-06-13 14:45:38	jazoff	almost there
2014-06-13 14:45:58	jazoff	now you just need to merge the row_lst together
2014-06-13 14:46:27	soehlert	i dont follow what you mean.
2014-06-13 14:46:44	jazoff	what does row_lst contain
2014-06-13 14:46:49	jazoff	what do you want instead as an end result
2014-06-13 14:47:05	soehlert	it starts empty. each time i append a row, it gets a string of that row
2014-06-13 14:47:23	soehlert	i get this: ['0, 0, 0, 0', '0, 0, 0, 0', '0, 0, 0, 0', '0, 0, 0, 0']
2014-06-13 14:47:33	soehlert	which looks right, but i can tell its not
2014-06-13 14:49:26	jazoff	so row_lst is what kind of varible?
2014-06-13 14:50:36	soehlert	its a list.
2014-06-13 14:51:01	soehlert	so now i have a list of strings or rows
2014-06-13 14:51:13	soehlert	strings OF rows
2014-06-13 14:52:28	jazoff	so how do you get that into one big string?
2014-06-13 14:53:26	soehlert	oooo right. so i iterate over that list and join each string
2014-06-13 14:54:18	soehlert	        for item in row_lst:
2014-06-13 14:54:18	soehlert	            grid_str = ', '.join(map(str, item))
2014-06-13 14:54:18	soehlert	        return grid_str
2014-06-13 14:54:52	soehlert	except that doesn't work out at all like i'd expect
2014-06-13 14:56:45	jazoff	nooo
2014-06-13 14:57:40	jazoff	howw does row_str = ', '.join(map(str, row)) work
2014-06-13 14:58:31	soehlert	joins each row (the element from self.grid) as a str separated by a ,
2014-06-13 14:59:30	jazoff	and which part does the joining
2014-06-13 15:00:05	soehlert	.join()
2014-06-13 15:02:59	jazoff	so that joins one row together
2014-06-13 15:03:07	jazoff	how do you think you should join row_lst together
2014-06-13 15:05:47	soehlert	im not sure i think thats the only way i know how.
2014-06-13 15:08:28	jazoff	if you had
2014-06-13 15:08:35	jazoff	row = [ "0", "0", "0"]
2014-06-13 15:08:45	jazoff	how would you make row_str from that
2014-06-13 15:11:54	soehlert	row_str = ",".join(map(str, row))
2014-06-13 15:12:01	jazoff	what does the map do?
2014-06-13 15:13:02	soehlert	map runs the str function on ever element of row
2014-06-13 15:13:15	jazoff	what's the purpose of that?
2014-06-13 15:13:24	soehlert	so i guess its not necessary in your case since row already was a list of strings
2014-06-13 15:13:34	jazoff	ok, so how can you simplify it
2014-06-13 15:14:01	soehlert	row_str = ', '.join(row)
2014-06-13 15:14:28	jazoff	what if you wanted it joined by newlines instead of commas
2014-06-13 15:14:49	soehlert	row_str = '\n '.join(row)
2014-06-13 15:14:54	jazoff	there you go
2014-06-13 15:15:02	soehlert	err
2014-06-13 15:15:02	soehlert	row_str = '\n'.join(row)
2014-06-13 15:15:17	soehlert	so i tried that and its not working at all
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	        row_lst = []
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	        for row in self.grid:
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	            row_str = ', '.join(map(str, row)) 
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	            row_lst.append(row_str)
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	    
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	        for item in row_lst:
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	            grid_str = '\n '.join(item)
2014-06-13 15:15:20	soehlert	        return grid_str
2014-06-13 15:15:35	jazoff	nooooooooooo
2014-06-13 15:15:41	jazoff	what is row_lst?
2014-06-13 15:15:51	soehlert	a list of strings
2014-06-13 15:15:57	soehlert	each string being a row
2014-06-13 15:16:05	jazoff	and what are you wanting to join together?
2014-06-13 15:16:59	jazoff	vs. wht are you actually joining together
2014-06-13 15:17:57	soehlert	i want to join together the list of strings
2014-06-13 15:18:23	jazoff	which is row_lst
2014-06-13 15:19:00	soehlert	right. so now i have a list of every row in string form. so that's what i want to return. except that list needs to be a string
2014-06-13 15:21:08	soehlert	        grid_str = '\n'.join(row_lst)
2014-06-13 15:21:08	soehlert	        return grid_str
2014-06-13 15:21:12	jazoff	YAY
2014-06-13 15:21:19	soehlert	god damn i make this way too hard
2014-06-13 15:21:20	jazoff	notice how simple? :)
2014-06-13 15:21:40	soehlert	yes incredibly. "except that list needs to be a string" that part took me so long to realize
2014-06-13 15:21:42	jazoff	i think you get confused because you rightly think "i need to loop over each row"
2014-06-13 15:21:53	jazoff	which is true, but join does the loopign for you
2014-06-13 15:22:07	soehlert	ah i hadnt thought of it like that
2014-06-13 15:25:42	soehlert	thanks for all the help with this. this class is MUCH harder than they suggested it would be..i think i'm gonna learn a ton though if i can get through it
2014-06-13 15:25:58	jazoff	sure
2014-06-13 15:26:07	jazoff	not sure  if you noticed, i'm flying in sunday for next week
2014-06-13 15:26:14	jazoff	so we can work on stuff together if you want
2014-06-13 15:27:08	soehlert	ah i knew it was soon. i may take you up on that this is all due monday, but then its on to the next week. the HW isn't too bad (so far) but these "mini" projects are wayyyy bigger than anything i've ever written
2014-06-13 15:29:39	jazoff	just split things up into pieces 
2014-06-13 15:31:14	soehlert	i am. that was just for one method haha. i've got a 100% on all the methods so far including the merge function! unfortunately, the move function and the random new tile ones are left.
2014-06-13 15:32:28	soehlert	this class is big on testing too, so were working on setting up tests for each method. that really helps me break it up individually.
2014-06-13 15:34:56	jazoff	yep
2014-06-13 16:18:14	soehlert	you still there?
2014-06-13 16:22:48	jazoff	yeah
2014-06-13 16:24:38	soehlert	list(tuple([0, dummy_x]) for dummy_x in range(grid_width)
2014-06-13 16:24:38	soehlert	does that create a list of tuples that are (0,X) where x is every possible x inside the range of 0-board width?
2014-06-13 16:24:59	jazoff	you don't need to call tuple to make a tuple
2014-06-13 16:25:03	jazoff	(0,1) makes a tuple
2014-06-13 16:25:29	soehlert	so i can do: list((0, dummy_x) for dummy_x in range(grid_width)
2014-06-13 16:25:44	soehlert	i dont need list either do i?
2014-06-13 16:25:45	jazoff	[(0,x) for x in range(grid_width)]
2014-06-13 16:26:06	soehlert	ya the dummy_x thing is just to keep pylint happy, but ok that makes sense then
2014-06-17 10:40:41	soehlert	quick bro question: if i run bro against a pcap, are the timestamps in conn.log the actual network timestamps
2014-06-17 10:47:24	jazoff	yeah
2014-06-17 10:52:21	soehlert	ok one other question actually..."what I want is the list on concurrent connections at any given time.   That's easy, it's in the connection state table.   But say I want the number of conconcurrent connections for each second of real time… I'm not sure how to do that other that print out the conn.log and parse it after the fact."
2014-06-17 10:52:26	soehlert	any idea how to pull that off?
2014-06-17 11:04:26	jazoff	that's kind of tricky
2014-06-17 11:04:46	jazoff	you can kinda do it by keeping track of the current count
2014-06-17 11:05:01	jazoff	every time there is a new connection increment it and any time a connection is closed decrement it
2014-06-17 11:05:15	jazoff	then just use schedule to log that count once per second
2014-06-17 11:21:45	soehlert	ok thanks
2014-06-23 11:57:14	soehlert	so I got a question for you on my project.
2014-06-23 11:57:24	soehlert	    cost_list = [(build_info.get_cost(item),item) for item in build_info.build_items()]
2014-06-23 11:57:24	soehlert	    print cost_list

2014-06-23 12:14:15	soehlert	cookies= <bound method ClickerState.get_cookies of <__main__.ClickerState object>>
2014-06-23 12:14:21	soehlert	i was expecting a number there..
2014-06-23 12:14:42	jazoff	where is cookies coming from?
2014-06-23 12:14:54	soehlert	def strategy_cheap(cookies, cps, time_left, build_info):
2014-06-23 12:18:59	jazoff	what is cookies in the other strategies?
2014-06-23 12:32:27	soehlert	gives me the same thing
2014-06-23 12:37:46	jazoff	well, i guess they are expecting you to call it
2014-06-23 12:38:07	jazoff	at least, that's what you'll need to do
2014-06-23 13:24:55	soehlert	that's what i figured, but that just returns" <function get_cookies>"
2014-06-23 13:28:31	jazoff	huh?
2014-06-23 13:29:47	soehlert	ya i dont know. i printed ClickerState.get_cookies() and that's what it printed out..
2014-06-23 13:44:02	jazoff	weird
2014-06-23 13:44:24	jazoff	oh wait
2014-06-23 13:44:25	jazoff	no
2014-06-23 13:44:27	jazoff	just print cookies()
2014-06-23 13:50:45	soehlert	aha it is a function. that returns 0.0
2014-06-23 13:50:45	soehlert	gotta figure out where that is coming from. obviously i can never buy anything if i have no cookies..
2014-06-23 13:51:32	jazoff	well, the first time through at least
2014-06-23 13:51:37	jazoff	doesn't it grow over time?
2014-06-23 13:52:08	soehlert	current cookies does, but that cookies parameter(?) always prints out 0.0
2014-06-23 13:54:29	jazoff	oh, seems like their thing is buggy
2014-06-23 13:55:01	soehlert	eh whatever. i think im gonna give up on this week. i still have a passing grade on this assingment anyways. 
2014-06-23 13:55:25	jazoff	that works too
2014-06-23 13:55:44	soehlert	this damn job getting int he way expecting me to not just do class work :)
2014-06-23 13:59:23	jazoff	:)
2014-06-30 11:37:29	jazoff	how's the python going?
2014-06-30 11:42:33	soehlert	i kinda gave up on that. it was causing too much stress and taking too much time. 
2014-06-30 11:42:43	soehlert	sucks but it wasnt worth my sanity
2014-06-30 11:49:40	jazoff	ah
2014-06-30 11:50:26	soehlert	I was really under the impression it was python class not math class that used python. didn't have time to teach myself math on top of python..plus i was killing both mine and your productivity here at work..
2014-06-30 11:54:02	jazoff	yeah, i don't know of a good "python for sysadmins" class
2014-06-30 11:55:06	soehlert	ya that really would be what i was looking for. focusing on python scritps instead of big giant programs.
2014-06-30 11:55:24	soehlert	oh well. i'll keep picking up a little here and a little there. one day i'll get it
2014-07-15 10:15:03	jazoff	echo 'echo "Warning: Container lifetime limit reached. Destroying container..."' | docker attach $ID
2014-07-17 15:44:56	soehlert	you around?
2014-07-24 08:10:28	jazoff	return max($seconds, $duration/$return_to_base_factor);
2015-01-09 15:53:54	jazoff	sure
2015-01-09 15:54:27	soehlert	need a recommendation for hosting and also possibly best language to write it in
2015-01-09 15:54:51	soehlert	so i play fantasy soccer with some people and theres really no good websites for it so a few people and i are thinking of maybe trying to write our own.
2015-01-09 15:54:51	jazoff	hosting what?
2015-01-09 15:54:58	jazoff	ah
2015-01-09 15:55:08	jazoff	heroku is pretty good but can get expensive
2015-01-09 15:55:21	jazoff	otherwise a cheap VPS on amazon or digital ocean is nice
2015-01-09 15:55:25	soehlert	obviously involving a big db
2015-01-09 15:55:25	soehlert	so idk if that changes things
2015-01-09 15:55:42	jazoff	yeah
2015-01-09 15:56:02	soehlert	are any of the VPS players better about DBs than others?
2015-01-09 15:57:05	jazoff	amazon has RDS but that gets expensive too
2015-01-09 15:57:53	soehlert	so is it just going to be down to price? or is amazon better with db performance or something?
2015-01-09 15:59:03	jazoff	well how big of a db are we talking?
2015-01-09 15:59:13	jazoff	it depends if you want a hosted db service or not
2015-01-09 15:59:43	soehlert	well its going to have be pretty huge. stats on players and every game in the english premier league, plus im assuming each fantasy league would need its own db 
2015-01-09 15:59:52	jazoff	heroku is nice because you run one command and you have a database
2015-01-09 15:59:59	soehlert	keeping track of lots of stats basically
2015-01-09 16:00:31	jazoff	but it gets expensive.. the one I used for the nike thing was the cheapest premium database and it costs $200/mo
2015-01-09 16:01:04	soehlert	gotcha.
2015-01-09 16:01:30	jazoff	there's nothing stopping you from just installing a database on a vps though, but then you have to do backups and stuff yourself
2015-01-09 16:01:46	jazoff	and replication and HA and all that fun stuff
2015-01-09 16:02:02	soehlert	right, though in the beginning at least that might be worth the cost savings until we have proof it would be worthwhile 
2015-01-09 16:02:25	soehlert	i get spoiled by work where i could just throw this up on any old machine and go haha. 
2015-01-09 16:02:34	jazoff	yeah
2015-01-09 16:02:47	jazoff	well on heroku the kinda 'dev' plans are pretty cheap
2015-01-09 16:03:14	soehlert	ok maybe that's where i'll look for the proof of concept stages
2015-01-09 16:03:33	soehlert	do you think a specific language would lend itself better to this sort of thing over others?
2015-01-09 16:03:36	jazoff	Hobby Basic  is 10/mo and you can have 10 million rows
2015-01-09 16:03:46	soehlert	oh that sounds doable for sure.
2015-01-09 16:04:29	jazoff	https://addons.heroku.com/heroku-postgresql
2015-01-09 16:05:02	jazoff	but yeah, it gets expensive fast 
2015-01-09 16:05:18	soehlert	sure does
2015-01-09 16:05:18	soehlert	wowza
2015-01-09 16:05:40	jazoff	but still cheaper than paying a DBA 100k/yr
2015-01-09 16:05:46	soehlert	haha thats very true.
2015-01-09 16:06:36	soehlert	as far as language goes, do you think this would be best done in a specific one?
2015-01-09 16:06:52	jazoff	python is good :)
2015-01-09 16:06:54	soehlert	got a few devs possibly interested, but if a language is better served we'll try to go with that
2015-01-09 16:07:06	soehlert	hahah figured youd say that. didnt know if itd be able to handle it all or what
2015-01-09 16:07:18	soehlert	any that wouldnt work very well at all for this?
2015-01-09 16:07:37	jazoff	not really
2015-01-09 16:07:46	soehlert	alright cool
2015-01-09 16:08:10	soehlert	thanks man
2015-01-09 16:10:20	jazoff	yeah, amazon and stuff gets expensive, but it's hard to factor in tco
2015-01-09 16:10:42	jazoff	http://aws.amazon.com/tco-calculator/ is fun to play with
2015-01-09 16:10:45	soehlert	ya for sure. luckily a couple of the guys here are project managers so that helps
2015-01-09 18:16:10	soehlert	one other question for you. do you just write all your python in vim or do you use IDLE or some other IDE
