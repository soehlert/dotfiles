2014-05-20 16:16:06	jazoff	we are not null routing it, but it doesn't look like it is making it out

2014-05-20 16:19:10	wraquel	Seems to route alright all the way to the home network.
2014-05-20 16:35:45	jazoff	yeah, I could connect from home and from UA
2014-05-20 16:36:05	jazoff	I suppose I could try banging on it and see if I get blocked :)

2014-06-03 09:01:20	kollross	past=pass
2014-06-03 09:09:10	eyrich	yes I did
2014-06-03 09:09:21	eyrich	you should have received an invite email
2014-06-03 09:09:38	kollross	yeah...about that. 
2014-06-03 09:10:26	kollross	so I use a password manager to generate random password.  only to have it change before it saved my login.
2014-06-03 09:10:41	kollross	soooo....i'm locked out.
2014-06-03 09:11:18	kollross	i tried a reset but said it couldn't and that the account needed to be deleted and re-created.
2014-06-03 09:11:21	kollross	:-)
2014-06-03 09:21:46	jazoff	one thing to also keep in mind with lastpass is that it gets confused with some illinois.edu domains.. 
2014-06-03 09:22:13	jazoff	it sometimes likes to think that foo.illinois.edu and bar.illinois.edu are the same site, and will update the password for both if you pick the wrong option
2014-06-03 09:22:14	eyrich	kollross: you used a random password for LastPass?
2014-06-03 09:22:38	eyrich	jazoff: never have it update passwords for you - do them by hand
2014-06-03 09:23:46	jazoff	well it was more when I was first setting it up
2014-06-03 09:24:27	jazoff	I had it create a password for splunk I think, and it gives you an option if you want to update the password or create a new entry
2014-06-03 09:24:42	jazoff	where 'update the password' means replace the password for some unrelated site
2014-06-03 09:26:02	kollross	I clicked on the link...it said change password.  which I did using the ramdom one, which didn't save.
2014-06-03 09:28:32	eyrich	kollross: so you do have lastpass access?  look for an entry that starts with Generated password for - 
2014-06-03 11:33:42	kollross	eyrich: no, I can't login because I don't know the password after I changed it.
2014-06-03 11:35:11	eyrich	i suggest using a memorable password for lastpass - do not have to be incediably hard since it requires a yubikey
2014-06-03 11:35:16	eyrich	I will send you a password reset
2014-06-03 11:36:29	eyrich	kollross: do you have any data stored in lastpass>?
2014-06-03 11:37:14	kollross	no
2014-06-03 11:37:16	kollross	never logged in
2014-06-03 11:38:09	eyrich	new account invite inbound
2014-06-03 11:38:15	kollross	got it

2014-09-26 14:54:42	buraglio	I've noticed that in the month I;'ve been in this building Bernie A'cs has not been in his office while I've been here durting the day ever.  not once.
2014-09-26 14:54:57	buraglio	durting/during
2014-09-26 14:55:16	soehlert	i thought he left
2014-09-26 15:00:05	buraglio	maybe that is why =)
2014-09-26 15:00:56	soehlert	I'll say this, we've noticed a decrease in issues that supports my theory
2014-09-26 15:01:34	wardog	Could be because I never lifted the bhr on some of his hosts.
2014-09-26 15:36:32	kollross	whats the irc bot call to see bro info on an IP
2014-09-26 15:36:46	soehlert	ncsabot
2014-09-26 15:36:56	kollross	can I call that from any channel
2014-09-26 15:37:11	soehlert	no, the bot has to be present in the channel
2014-09-26 15:37:35	kollross	can he join this channel
2014-09-26 15:37:44	kollross	i'm sorry...it
2014-09-26 15:37:56	soehlert	i dont know off the top of my head, i'll take a look at the code and give it at ry
2014-09-26 15:38:22	kollross	well another question maybe easier
2014-09-26 15:38:44	kollross	I'm trying to see if any connections are coming in from an IP to iforge.
2014-09-26 15:38:51	soehlert	whats the ip?
2014-09-26 15:39:04	kollross	207.235.68.178
2014-09-26 15:40:08	soehlert	well its seen on our network, ncsabot doesnt really know how to differentiate between specific ips on our side though
2014-09-26 15:40:19	soehlert	i guess netflows would be better for that
2014-09-26 15:40:37	kollross	right, i'm not sure how to generate that info
2014-09-26 15:41:40	kollross	do you see that iP doing anything...regardless of iforge or not.
2014-09-26 15:41:45	soehlert	yes
2014-09-26 15:42:04	soehlert	i'm trying to get some more detailed info for you as far as iforge
2014-09-26 15:42:04	soehlert	whats the iforge net?
2014-09-26 15:42:42	kollross	141.142.166.1
2014-09-26 15:43:58	kollross	 \/22
2014-09-26 15:45:10	soehlert	gimme a sec gotta figure this out, usually jazoff or eyrich do the flows stuff
2014-09-26 15:45:32	kollross	likewise on my side
2014-09-26 15:48:38	soehlert	hmm i cant seem to get my filters totally right, but i am seeing this
2014-09-26 15:48:53	soehlert	2014-08-22T10:21:08.725225 CxFELr2RY5AlJ69Mxf 207.235.68.178 40511 141.142.166.1 22 tcp ssh 12.485268 5535 5110 SF F 0 ShAdDaFf 36 6995 34 6482 (empty) US US nids-28-6

2014-09-26 15:49:21	soehlert	are they supposed to be ssh'ing to .1?
2014-09-26 15:49:33	kollross	correct
2014-09-26 15:49:49	kollross	and thats the newest connect dates...8-22
2014-09-26 15:50:42	soehlert	that ip was seen on 8/12, 8/22, and one line from today
2014-09-26 15:50:46	soehlert	2014-09-26T08:28:17.400310CL0zgS2V8dJcK72e5a141.142.166.18207.235.68.1780icmp-0.9993581120OTHT0-216800(empty)USUSnids-28-1

2014-09-26 15:51:58	kollross	ok thanks for looking that up
2014-09-26 15:52:10	soehlert	sure thing
2014-09-29 09:20:46	wardog	you can chat directly with the bot too.
2014-09-29 09:38:41	soehlert	wardog: as in msg ncsabot?
