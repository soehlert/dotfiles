2014-04-15 10:08:34	Jerknette	anyway, did I miss anything?
2014-04-15 10:08:47	soehlert_	thats why you should run a cli client inside of screen
2014-04-15 10:08:57	Jerknette	bah
2014-04-15 10:08:59	soehlert_	and idk i changed my client yesterday and so i was in and out

2014-04-15 10:09:48	Jerknette	sadpacket, Dop and I are going back and forth about whether he should buy a rifle, I'm against it because I don't think he'd get the value out of it.  We don't have a range large enough anywhere near our house, so I think after a year or so it'll sit, untouched in the safe for five years until I convince him to sell it.  I decided if he buys a rifle I'm
2014-04-15 10:09:48	Jerknette	going to by GoogleGlass
2014-04-15 10:10:12	soehlert_	now i want him to buy one so i can call you glasshole
2014-04-15 10:10:20	Jerknette	laugh now

2014-04-15 10:11:46	Jerknette	I can run pretty fast
2014-04-15 10:11:50	Jerknette	I'll catch up
2014-04-15 10:26:11	Dop2_	we'll even tell you where we are, but you won't be able to find it without my help.
2014-04-15 10:26:29	soehlert_	well she will have the whole glasses thing going on..
2014-04-15 10:32:33	Jerknette	sam, come on, we know me
2014-04-15 10:32:50	Jerknette	there's a 50/50 chance the glasses will help my direction sense

2014-04-15 10:48:36	tljohnsn	Hmm - I feel it will mess up my notification system.
2014-04-15 10:49:06	mikede	Jerknette: you should just use irccloud and be done with it
2014-04-15 10:49:23	Jerknette	I'm using IRC cloud
2014-04-15 10:49:32	mikede	Also you should get a google glass and a Tesla model S
2014-04-15 10:49:46	Jerknette	but my work laptop doesn't always stay connected, this week I'm homeless
2014-04-15 10:49:48	soehlert_	maybe i should set up the relay for weechat and give you access. you can even use a browser client..
2014-04-15 10:50:31	Jerknette	don't worry about it, it usually loads the stuff I missed when I log back in

2014-04-15 10:58:07	Jerknette	I baked it with veggies lined up around the meatloaf so they baked and I could toss them in the meat juice when it was done
2014-04-15 10:58:41	Jerknette	mikede: I hear you, I'm hungry for my leftovers and I have to pretend I'm a normal person and wait at least another half hour before lunch

2014-04-16 11:33:47	tljohnsn	O'Reilly will pay for me to go to sonoma county next week.  I would have to go to meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that would suck, but I could slack off the rest of the week.  I'm torn.
2014-04-16 11:34:17	soehlert_	that seems pretty awesome. Sonoma would be sweet right about now
2014-04-16 11:34:29	tljohnsn	But it's getting so nice here
2014-04-16 11:34:33	Dop2_	what's the local forcast here that week?
2014-04-16 11:34:44	soehlert_	but you can go there when its already nice, then come back when its just as nice here
2014-04-16 11:34:54	soehlert_	so you can skip that last week (hopefully) of the 50 degree days
2014-04-16 11:36:45	tljohnsn	Also, I will have to deal with people I can't stand for 2 days....  The upside is I could hang out with scott after and work on zoku.
2014-04-16 11:38:41	tljohnsn	Champaign is forgast 67, 71, 72, 78, 75
2014-04-16 11:39:17	tljohnsn	Sonoma is 70, 65, 68,70, 68
2014-04-16 11:40:56	Dop2_	this is the dumbest argument I've heard all week.   Arguing about using mod_security because it's open source when 10 lines up are two Linux OS versions.
2014-04-16 11:41:18	Dop2_	Could you cancel your other trip to see Scott during your week off?
2014-04-16 11:41:53	tljohnsn	Already got non-refundable tickets, so I'd have to pay $400 to do that.
2014-04-16 11:42:13	soehlert_	if you already have tickets, isnt that kinda already decision over?
2014-04-16 11:42:21	tljohnsn	And heather is coming on that so she'd be real pissed if I cancelled
2014-04-16 11:42:41	tljohnsn	Tickets are for later in may.
2014-04-16 11:42:41	Dop2_	two different trips, Sam.
2014-04-16 11:43:17	soehlert_	stop confusing me
2014-04-16 11:44:28	tljohnsn	I feel staying home is probably better since I can slack off more with everyone else gone.
2014-04-16 11:45:08	tljohnsn	And finding motivation to work on ost stuff has become very hard.
2014-04-16 11:45:43	tljohnsn	And everyone else is leaving so I would have to drive myself.
2014-04-16 11:47:17	tljohnsn	I should have quit in winter.
2014-04-16 11:49:21	tljohnsn	Dop2_: what time you get back to bmi?
2014-04-16 11:49:57	tljohnsn	I need like 24 of these landscape timbers but they only had 13 in champaign.
2014-04-16 11:50:18	tljohnsn	Apparantly there are some in danville and bloomington
2014-04-16 11:51:32	tljohnsn	But maybe I could meet you at the airport and trade vehicles with you.
2014-04-16 11:53:36	Dop2_	Friday afternoon.
2014-04-16 11:54:20	Dop2_	I could just pick them up for you if you're real clear on what they are.
2014-04-16 11:55:40	tljohnsn	Well, I wouldn't want you to miss happy hour or your dinner plans.  I thought you were going to clue that night?
2014-04-16 11:57:10	Dop2_	that's not til late.  I think I hit Bloomington by 2pm-ish.
2014-04-16 11:57:21	tljohnsn	And the menards is like way north of town.
2014-04-16 11:58:26	tljohnsn	Oh hmm, that's pretty early - you could still make happy hour...
2014-04-16 11:58:40	Dop2_	and 'way north' is like.. 5-10min from the airport.
2014-04-16 12:00:14	tljohnsn	Ok, if you could get them for me, that would be awesome - I will buy all your beers at happy hour.
2014-04-16 12:00:31	tljohnsn	I will call first to make sure the for sure have enough.
2014-04-16 12:01:04	Dop2_	Yeah, just email me some info on what you need.  Maybe they'll reserve them for you (but I doubt it)
2014-04-16 12:02:00	Dop2_	I assume 24 of these isn't over like 1000 lbs.  :)
2014-04-16 12:14:14	Jerknette	Dop: don't forget to add an alarm to your phone, I wish I did that when you asked me to mail back the duffle bags
2014-04-16 12:16:06	Dop2_	oh crap, looks like I don't return to BMI until 4:30pm.   But that doesn't change my ability to pick up timbers.
2014-04-16 12:17:20	Dop2_	that means a lot more time in the Skyclub on Friday morning.
2014-04-16 12:30:04	mikede	Recover from your hangovers?

2014-04-18 13:53:03	soehlert_	i wonder if i could run bro and then fake some traffic too...
2014-04-18 13:53:21	WeeJay	absolutely you can. you can do just about everything you can do with physical devices
2014-04-18 13:54:01	WeeJay	if i get around to setting up my lab....ill give you remote access to it.

2014-04-22 08:01:35	mostlybadfly	I heard a story yesterday saying you should wait until 930 to get coffee but I can't do it
2014-04-22 08:02:35	Jerknette	what's so good about 9:30?
2014-04-22 08:02:43	Jerknette	what if you're up at 5 like me? :)

2014-04-22 08:06:05	mostlybadfly	They're saying that cortisol levels ate higher up until that time
2014-04-22 08:06:15	mostlybadfly	Which act as natural alertness whatever
2014-04-22 08:06:29	mostlybadfly	So coffee is most impactful after cortisol levels drop
2014-04-22 08:06:46	mostlybadfly	Yeah I was trying to find info on that since I wake up at 530
2014-04-22 08:06:58	Jerknette	bah!  I can't handle  pseudo science this early in the morning, somebody get me my coffee
2014-04-22 08:08:55	mostlybadfly	Haha yeah
2014-04-22 08:09:37	mostlybadfly	I'm trying to wait just to see if it is true lol  but I doubt I'll know what I'm doing or why
2014-04-22 08:09:50	mostlybadfly	Given I already feel tired and not alert
2014-04-22 08:30:11	mostlybadfly	Jerknette: whoa I kinda woke up more hmmmm

2014-04-22 09:57:50	mostlybadfly	I'm assuming this could correspond to food I dunno

2014-04-23 12:36:48	Jerknette	shh!  I'm concentrating
2014-04-23 12:40:00	mostlybadfly	45 shootings this past weekend
2014-04-23 12:40:07	mostlybadfly	Breaking records left and right
2014-04-23 12:40:52	Jerknette	whoa, what is happening?  is this a side effect of recession, gun regulation?
2014-04-23 12:41:02	Jerknette	drug wars?
2014-04-23 12:44:40	soehlert_	it usually coincides with the weather
2014-04-23 12:46:37	Dop2_	shootings caused by global warming.
2014-04-23 13:00:17	Jerknette	an uptick I get, but a surge is different
2014-04-23 13:01:12	soehlert_	theres literally giant surge every spring
2014-04-23 13:01:28	soehlert_	people are cooped up and cant hit their quotas over the winter...gotta get back on track
2014-04-23 13:15:00	mikede	Wow I really want to move to Chicago :P
2014-04-23 13:19:36	soehlert_	well its a little unfair to says it an all of Chicago issue. The murders are usually pretty well concentrated
2014-04-23 13:20:08	mikede	...in Chicago
2014-04-23 13:20:19	soehlert_	certain parts yes. same as any other big city
2014-04-23 13:26:40	mikede	Not Seattle, it is fill with caffeine infused unicorns
2014-04-23 13:26:54	soehlert_	haha sounds lovely
2014-04-23 13:27:47	wort	hipsters are afraid of guns
2014-04-23 13:29:27	Dop2_	you can't conceal a gun in pants so tight your balls turn blue.
2014-04-23 13:32:30	mikede	Are you making fun of my wardrobe again Dop?
2014-04-23 13:34:01	mostlybadfly	I wonder if hipsters will ever ironically wield guns
2014-04-23 13:34:28	mostlybadfly	Like I can see gold rush era holsters and cowboy gear being a thing
2014-04-23 13:35:06	mostlybadfly	There is a wooden pole to tie up your fixy at the local cafe
2014-04-23 13:37:41	mikede	That sounds like an awesome idea
2014-04-23 13:40:13	Jerknette	steam punk meets the NRA?
2014-04-23 13:44:04	Jerknette	"you can pry my blunderbuss from my cold, dead hands"
2014-04-23 13:46:00	mostlybadfly	I was thinking of a more authentic prospector thing
2014-04-23 13:46:14	mostlybadfly	Like how pioneer was a look for a while
2014-04-23 13:50:15	mostlybadfly	And the unfortunate and racist sporting of headdresses
2014-04-23 13:53:08	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: I don't know what you're problem is, they are honoring native americans
2014-04-23 13:53:34	mostlybadfly	Stop lol
2014-04-23 13:53:57	Jerknette	it's like growing ringlets to support the Jewish community, or wearing blackface in solidarity of one's black roomate
2014-04-23 13:54:11	mostlybadfly	Hahahaha
2014-04-23 13:54:36	Dop2_	wow...
2014-04-23 13:54:45	Jerknette	you would not believe the number of Chief "now and forever" bumper stickers in this town
2014-04-23 13:54:45	Dop2_	I think you could be onto a money maker here.
2014-04-23 13:54:52	Dop2_	open carry of fake guns.
2014-04-23 13:56:58	mostlybadfly	I can see guys with beards toting pop guns or something
2014-04-23 13:59:10	Dop2_	where's Kevin?
2014-04-23 13:59:16	Dop2_	I need to know the law around this.
2014-04-23 14:08:03	mikede	I am surprised this has not occurred in Seattle really given our prospector roots
2014-04-23 14:10:01	wort	Anyone else here in the office having packet loss issues?
2014-04-23 14:10:39	Dop2_	yes

2014-04-24 10:28:07	buraglio	actually, strike that.  He used to work for Mandiant
2014-04-24 10:28:19	buraglio	FireEye is probably a Bro competitor
2014-04-24 10:28:28	mikede	Just get VC that is what all the cool kids are doing
2014-04-24 10:28:29	mikede	:P
2014-04-24 10:30:10	buraglio	VC implies loss of control at some point
2014-04-24 10:30:21	mikede	Very much so
2014-04-24 10:30:25	mikede	I wasn't being serious
2014-04-24 10:30:31	buraglio	I'd rather be poor and in control than rich and a puppet
2014-04-24 10:30:45	soehlert_	but puppet makes my life so much easier
2014-04-24 10:30:58	buraglio	I said "a puppet" not "puppet"
2014-04-24 10:30:59	mikede	VC for the most part is just a different lottery, imho
2014-04-24 10:31:08	buraglio	VC is ballsack
2014-04-24 10:31:15	 *	soehlert_ is a not very funny smartass
2014-04-24 10:31:39	buraglio	at the whim of some turd that thinks they know what's up
2014-04-24 10:31:53	buraglio	soehlert_: no, I got it.  It just wasn't funny
2014-04-24 10:31:55	buraglio	=)
2014-04-24 10:33:01	soehlert_	thats the point, if Jerknette's gonna call me a grandpa I imght as well use grandpa jokes.
2014-04-24 10:34:10	Jerknette	I liked your joke, grandpa(soehlert_ )
2014-04-24 10:34:42	Jerknette	I don't think we can accept VC, Bro is funded through NSF, ICSI(UC Berkeley) and NCSA
2014-04-24 10:40:00	buraglio	yeah

2014-04-24 10:41:09	Jerknette	we're launching the registration page and events page soon
2014-04-24 10:41:13	buraglio	I may try and get some other ESnet folks to go

2014-04-24 10:42:37	buraglio	I'll make sure to DDoS it

2014-04-24 10:44:18	Jerknette	one of the women attending already has something like two or three kids, so I'm guessing she'll be pretty pissed if she gets pregnant again
2014-04-24 10:44:34	buraglio	I can't procreate via formication any more and I'm so awesome my body found another way
2014-04-24 10:44:50	soehlert_	i did not expect to have this conversation today
2014-04-24 10:45:16	buraglio	WILDCARD, BITCHES!

2014-04-24 10:46:19	Jerknette	dusts shoulders, walks away
2014-04-24 10:46:32	soehlert_	is it just me or does flics sound much dirtier than flicks/

2014-04-24 14:20:01	mikede	I know
2014-04-24 14:20:15	mikede	You should be unimpressed with me always, I am kind of lame
2014-04-24 14:20:35	mikede	What's up mostlybadfly?
2014-04-24 14:21:44	mostlybadfly	mikede: nothing just curious. Starting to learn
2014-04-24 14:22:18	mikede	Ah ok
2014-04-24 14:22:26	mikede	Lots of magic in that framework, imho
2014-04-24 14:22:35	soehlert_	what prompted the desire to learn rails mbf?
2014-04-24 14:23:24	mostlybadfly	I guess just to explore it and see where it takes me
2014-04-24 14:23:29	mostlybadfly	Unhappiness with my job
2014-04-24 14:23:36	soehlert_	but i mean howd you pick rails?
2014-04-24 14:23:45	mostlybadfly	And want to work on my blog
2014-04-24 14:23:51	soehlert_	ahhh
2014-04-24 14:23:55	mostlybadfly	And build a recipe making app
2014-04-24 14:24:16	mostlybadfly	I started learning ruby and became a fan
2014-04-24 14:24:55	tljohnsn	The "magic" in rails has always annoyed me a bit - have you looked at node?
2014-04-24 14:25:45	mikede	I don't like node
2014-04-24 14:26:02	mikede	Why do you like Node tljohnsn?
2014-04-24 14:26:16	Jerknette	sadpacket
2014-04-24 14:26:20	mostlybadfly	No I haven't but people have suggested it
2014-04-24 14:26:55	tljohnsn	Mostly from a sysadmin perspective, it's a lot easier to work with, the package management isn't so f'd like ror.
2014-04-24 14:26:58	Jerknette	I just announced BroCon '14 on the twitters, will you retweet me?  And don't forget to register
2014-04-24 14:27:15	mostlybadfly	Is it bad that I don't know what to do with ruby besides using rails for app development
2014-04-24 14:27:28	Jerknette	give yourself a break
2014-04-24 14:27:31	Jerknette	you're still learning
2014-04-24 14:29:35	mostlybadfly	Yeah true. I feel guilty just doing rails hehe
2014-04-24 14:29:36	mostlybadfly	But i can visualize more what i want to do and that prob matters most
2014-04-24 14:42:52	mostlybadfly	It just fascinates me like a puzzle or when i studied linguistics
2014-04-24 14:59:39	mikede	tljohnsn: npm rocks and I think that is the best thing that has come out of node :)
2014-04-24 14:59:57	mikede	I hate how you end up having tons of nested callbacks, etc...
2014-04-24 15:00:11	mikede	Figure anything you could write in perl, python you can write in ruby
2014-04-24 15:00:27	tljohnsn	Agreed

2014-04-28 12:56:47	soehlert_	since its my grandpa and he doesnt konw what it is

2014-04-28 13:41:09	soehlert_	As far as I know it's running fine. Can even get the choke in without it dying it sounds like. 
2014-04-28 13:41:26	tljohnsn	What was up with it?
2014-04-28 13:42:30	soehlert_	Well not positive, but we totally cleaned and jetted the carbs. We put in new spark plugs. A few other little thing (bad fuel line and brake/clutch lever)
2014-04-28 13:42:59	soehlert_	I think we need to fix the kickstand still but it seems to be running better than it was last year.
2014-04-28 13:43:11	soehlert_	oh and i think wort found a crack in one of the carbs too
2014-04-28 13:45:13	tljohnsn	How hard is carb overhaul on that thing?
2014-04-28 13:45:15	wort_	Yeah, also I think the battery was nearly dead, the tires were really low, the float bowls weren't on quite tight enough, and throttle cables were on backwards.
2014-04-28 13:45:42	soehlert_	carb overhaul was pretty easy (though apparently we didnt quite get it right)
2014-04-28 13:45:51	tljohnsn	Man, tons of problems.
2014-04-28 13:45:53	wort_	Close enough
2014-04-28 13:46:08	soehlert_	oh right. i wasnt counting battery and tires cuz those were little things i was gonna do before she rode. didnt know she was gonna try this weekend while i was gone
2014-04-28 13:47:23	soehlert_	tljohnsn: not surprising really. and old bike and to be honest she didnt do too much looking around. kinda latched on to this one pretty quickly
2014-04-28 14:01:08	Dop2_	havign a bike would be fun, but I think I'd buy a bobcat first.
2014-04-28 14:01:18	soehlert_	skidders are the shit
2014-04-28 14:02:15	Dop2_	especially the ones with tracks instead of wheels.
2014-04-28 14:02:44	soehlert_	oh absolutely. if you're gonna get such a fun toy, why would you ever ease up and not get the tracks?
2014-04-28 14:03:08	Dop2_	though admittedly, I suck at making a smooth level surface.
2014-04-28 14:03:35	tljohnsn	practice makes perfect?
2014-04-28 14:03:37	soehlert_	They never trusted me to do stuff like that, but it sure was fun just carrying stuff around in the bucket
2014-04-28 14:04:59	Dop2_	I was driving one INTO Jake's garage addtion.  One wrong move and there goes the wall.
2014-04-28 14:05:20	soehlert_	Thats scary
2014-04-28 14:05:35	Dop2_	what do these things cost?
2014-04-28 14:06:14	wort_	http://chambana.craigslist.org/hvo/4415001524.html
2014-04-28 14:06:28	soehlert_	Looks like low 5 figures
2014-04-28 14:07:11	tljohnsn	http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/301154814254?lpid=82
2014-04-28 14:07:30	tljohnsn	Not quite as fun, but you already have the tractor
2014-04-28 14:08:19	Dop2_	yeah, that wouldn't have the power I'm looking for.
2014-04-28 14:09:55	Dop2_	and what brand??  Do I actually go Bobcat or Case?  My uncle is a Case sales guy.
2014-04-28 14:10:14	soehlert_	Ive only driven the bobcat. Though its always nice having a hookup..
2014-04-28 14:13:15	Dop2_	Case's website is shit
2014-04-28 14:13:40	soehlert_	bobcats require you send off for a quote instead of just telling you how much they cost
2014-04-28 14:13:51	Dop2_	god dammit, I hate that shit.
2014-04-28 14:13:57	soehlert_	surriously
2014-04-28 14:14:03	tljohnsn	gehl?
2014-04-28 14:14:17	Dop2_	whoa... new Case skid steer ~$50k
2014-04-28 14:14:52	tljohnsn	They make the gehl ones in the town I lived in - West bend, WI
2014-04-28 14:15:06	tljohnsn	My dad designed round balers for them.
2014-04-28 14:15:58	tljohnsn	But I always remember seeing tons of skid steers coming of the line whenever he would take me to the plant
2014-04-28 14:19:35	buraglio	....and.....talk submission made to BroCon 2014
2014-04-28 14:20:04	buraglio	Title: "Best practices for Securing the Science DMZ and how to break Dop's finger because he's a pussy"
2014-04-28 14:21:21	soehlert_	i look forward to seeing this one
2014-04-28 14:21:25	soehlert_	sounds informative
2014-04-28 14:23:00	buraglio	the last part is pretty straightforward
2014-04-28 14:24:24	Dop2_	My finger is stronger now than it ever was before you broke it.
2014-04-28 14:24:47	buraglio	and I[m stronger now than I've been since I was like 25 and bodybuilding
2014-04-28 14:25:00	buraglio	I can't wait to get back on the mat
2014-04-28 14:25:07	buraglio	hey, does Jack have a kids class here in CU?
2014-04-28 14:25:16	buraglio	Luke has expressed a little bit of interest
2014-04-28 14:25:37	buraglio	and I got buy-in from the boss if it's not like a billion dollars
2014-04-28 14:28:43	Dop2_	no, not yet.  I want him to.   They've got one in peoria under Peplow, but that's a bit of a drive.
2014-04-28 14:28:55	buraglio	yeah, it's closer to go to freaking TH
2014-04-28 14:28:58	buraglio	damn
2014-04-28 14:29:11	Dop2_	We've got people as young as 14 in the fundamentals class.
2014-04-28 14:29:32	buraglio	well, Luke is 5
2014-04-28 14:29:49	buraglio	and as full of energy as me and every bit as contrary at times
2014-04-28 14:30:54	Dop2_	what we need is Jack to get his own fucking place and then the kids class will be a no brainer.
2014-04-28 14:31:00	buraglio	yeah
2014-04-28 14:31:02	buraglio	he never will
2014-04-28 14:31:09	buraglio	I told him that like 10 years ago
2014-04-28 14:31:27	Dop2_	Fitness Center just gives him too good of a deal cause they need him to make them look good.
2014-04-28 14:31:33	buraglio	yeah
2014-04-28 14:31:41	Dop2_	My hope is they finally just go backrupt and he's forced.
2014-04-28 14:31:50	buraglio	yeah
2014-04-28 14:32:08	buraglio	I may start coming again after Luke starts kindergarden
2014-04-28 14:32:56	buraglio	since we won't be paying a mortgage payment for his school at that point
2014-04-28 14:33:46	Dop2_	awesome.
2014-04-28 14:33:56	Dop2_	FC is in bad financial shape.
2014-04-28 14:34:04	buraglio	we'll only be paying a mortgage payment for Zachs =P
2014-04-28 14:34:25	buraglio	I'm sure they are, they've failed to evolve
2014-04-28 14:34:33	buraglio	and they are EXPENSIVE
2014-04-28 14:48:21	mikede__	Dop just buy a place for Jack
2014-04-28 14:53:57	Dop2_	If I had a bunch of money I would.
2014-04-28 14:54:12	buraglio	have kev buy it
2014-04-28 15:02:28	Jerknette	Dop2_: "If I had a bunch of money I would." Uhh, no you wouldn't.
2014-04-28 15:04:04	Dop2_	(I totally would.)
2014-04-28 15:04:22	Jerknette	(no you wouldn't)
2014-04-28 15:04:29	soehlert_	(i think he would)
2014-04-28 15:04:43	Jerknette	(I think you should stay out of it)
2014-04-28 15:04:53	soehlert_	(that doesnt sound like me)
2014-04-28 15:05:30	Jerknette	(you're out of your element)
2014-04-28 15:10:44	soehlert_	(you can't handle the truth)
2014-04-28 15:11:03	Jerknette	(meow, do you know how fast you were going?)
2014-04-28 15:28:26	Dop2_	Come on Jeannette, can you imagine your own personal gym on the corner of Market/Olympian?
2014-04-28 15:28:45	soehlert_	with a big woodshop in the back?
2014-04-28 15:40:52	Dop2_	no, that's a separate building closer to home.
2014-04-28 15:51:44	Jerknette	Come on Dop2_ can you imagine taking out a loan for $400K on the chance that McVicker will keep teaching long enough for US to make a profit?  There is no reason for him to buy his own place, he makes too much off renting.  Why do you think him renting from us would be any different?
2014-04-28 15:52:07	Jerknette	jack is first and foremost a business man
2014-04-28 15:56:12	Dop2_	I think you're missing the definition of "bunch of money"
2014-04-28 15:56:21	Dop2_	I wouldn't do it if I needed a loan.
2014-04-28 16:26:15	tljohnsn	Jerknette: Crap, we should have gone to live karoke last week thursday
2014-04-28 16:38:07	Dop2_	she was in Chicago.
2014-04-28 16:39:05	tljohnsn	Oh, I thought she left Friday AM.

2014-04-29 10:09:43	tljohnsn	Nope - hong kong is the closest I've been.
2014-04-29 10:13:37	mikede__	Nope
2014-04-29 10:14:00	soehlert_	Nope
2014-04-29 10:16:01	mikede__	Come on demolition people get here
2014-04-29 10:56:37	soehlert_	what are we demolishing?
2014-04-29 11:06:11	Jerknette	I'm crap with a shovel but pretty good with a sledgehammer, I can help speed things up
2014-04-29 11:32:59	soehlert_	anyone in chambana area use a house cleaner person?
2014-04-29 11:41:36	Jerknette	soehlert_: yes
2014-04-29 11:41:37	Jerknette	we do
2014-04-29 11:41:49	soehlert_	how expensive is it?
2014-04-29 11:42:03	Jerknette	we've had her since January and are pretty happy with it, we pay her about $80 every two weeks
2014-04-29 11:42:10	Jerknette	she visits every two weeks
2014-04-29 11:42:19	soehlert_	ok
2014-04-29 11:42:38	Jerknette	Dop can give you her contact info
2014-04-29 11:52:14	Dop2_	done.
2014-04-29 11:52:51	soehlert_	cool thanks. not sure if i wanna do it or not, but id like to get a quote at least
2014-04-29 11:56:04	Dop2_	it's worth it.
2014-04-29 11:56:32	tljohnsn	Would you roommate split it with you or what?
2014-04-29 11:57:08	Dop2_	I keep forgetting Sam has a roommate like he's still in college.
2014-04-29 11:57:49	tljohnsn	Dude, we still had roommates for a few years after.
2014-04-29 11:58:34	tljohnsn	Hell, I was graduated the last year I lived with you guys on campus.
2014-04-29 11:58:45	Dop2_	oh shit.. that's right.
2014-04-29 11:59:01	Dop2_	We were poor though.
2014-04-29 11:59:17	Dop2_	I'm still gonna give Sam shit, you can't stop me.
2014-04-29 11:59:31	tljohnsn	No once we moved to baytowne
2014-04-29 11:59:40	tljohnsn	s/No/Not/
2014-04-29 11:59:54	tljohnsn	Then we were ballers.
2014-04-29 12:00:08	soehlert_	id probably make him
2014-04-29 12:00:15	Dop2_	you're not helping, Trent.
2014-04-29 12:00:20	soehlert_	though he might be outta here for good in two months
2014-04-29 12:00:49	soehlert_	also, Dop2_ you once told me to keep having roommates as long as possible..
2014-04-29 12:01:05	tljohnsn	Listen to the old Dop2_
2014-04-29 12:01:28	soehlert_	i am. but this is it
2014-04-29 12:01:28	soehlert_	i wont know anyone younger than you guys in town after this summer
2014-04-29 12:01:41	tljohnsn	I had a roomate until like 1 year before I got married I think.
2014-04-29 12:01:56	tljohnsn	Haha, welcome to getting old like us.
2014-04-29 12:02:05	soehlert_	i dont like it
2014-04-29 12:03:49	Dop2_	it's great.
2014-04-29 12:04:02	Dop2_	age-ism is real.
2014-04-29 12:04:21	soehlert_	on one hand. on the other my drum lessons are coming to a close, my soccer season is going to be over tonight, so i wont see people ever
2014-04-29 12:05:06	Dop2_	take a vet or organic chem class at Parkland and meet hot chicks.
2014-04-29 12:05:30	Dop2_	or take a welding class and I'll do it with you if the schedule doesn't suck.
2014-04-29 12:05:48	soehlert_	ive actually looked into that, but it they all are during the day
2014-04-29 12:05:56	Dop2_	so?
2014-04-29 12:06:02	soehlert_	but maybe thats different
2014-04-29 12:06:02	soehlert_	thats a good idea for later 
2014-04-29 12:06:09	soehlert_	so i have that work thing..
2014-04-29 12:06:21	Dop2_	I know all about your work thing.
2014-04-29 12:06:22	tljohnsn	Unfortunately if you hang out with us you won't meet new people, since we hate people we don't know by default
2014-04-29 12:06:31	soehlert_	i am the same way
2014-04-29 12:06:37	Dop2_	it's actually very odd that we have so many friends.
2014-04-29 12:06:39	soehlert_	which is why i like hanging out with you guys
2014-04-29 12:07:33	Dop2_	I think if I took at class at Parkland I'd be constantly fucking with Jake Brand.
2014-04-29 12:07:48	soehlert_	this sounds more fun lemme look at the schedule...
2014-04-29 12:09:27	Dop2_	yeah, if you find it let me know, I'm on Parkland's site.
2014-04-29 12:09:30	Dop2_	WLD 111
2014-04-29 12:09:38	soehlert_	ya i see that, but not times
2014-04-29 12:10:59	soehlert_	summer courses: lecture 6-7:50pm MW lab 8-9:40pm mw
2014-04-29 12:12:36	Dop2_	yikes...
2014-04-29 12:12:41	soehlert_	ya
2014-04-29 12:13:06	Dop2_	I think we need a custom class.
2014-04-29 12:13:24	soehlert_	hah that would be pretty sweet
2014-04-29 12:13:27	Dop2_	I can probably pick up the lecture material quicker than 4 hours per week.
2014-04-29 12:14:40	soehlert_	ya. i feel like 4 hours of lecture total and then a bunch of practice not 2 hours of lecture a week for 8 weeks..
2014-04-29 13:13:27	mikede__	My bathroom is being demo'd today and a remodel is starting tomorrow
2014-04-29 13:38:26	Dop2_	boom, 2 more street sweeper blades and it wasn't even a long walk.
2014-04-29 13:53:07	wort	mikede__: That sounds like fun
2014-04-29 13:53:27	soehlert_	Dop2_: what do you use those for again?
2014-04-29 13:53:49	Dop2_	lockpicks.
2014-04-29 13:54:10	Dop2_	mostly I just collect them so when I get back into lockpicking I'll have the materials.
2014-04-29 13:54:21	Dop2_	Got 10 or so sitting here.
2014-04-29 13:55:08	soehlert_	right right
2014-04-29 13:57:14	mikede__	Sounds like you are becoming a hoarder Dop2_
2014-04-29 13:58:38	Dop2_	I'm a bit of a material for projects hoarder, yes.  Luckily, most of it is all small.
2014-04-29 13:58:56	Dop2_	and I do go through occasional purges.
2014-04-29 13:59:24	mikede__	Jerknette: Is what Dop is saying true?
2014-04-29 13:59:58	wort	Some of those purges aren't exactly Dop's choice :)
2014-04-29 14:00:42	mikede__	*shocking*
2014-04-29 14:02:59	Dop2_	I never claimed they were my choice.
2014-04-29 14:03:06	tljohnsn	I am currently on a desk purge.
2014-04-29 14:24:04	mikede__	I am currently on a house purge
2014-04-29 14:26:00	Dop2_	as in... getting rid of houses.
2014-04-29 14:26:06	mikede__	Well that too
2014-04-29 14:26:17	mikede__	Almost down to one yay!!! :)
2014-04-29 14:27:26	tljohnsn	Man - having one house is enough pain in the ass for me.
2014-04-29 14:27:46	mikede__	The house I am moving back to is a total fixer so it will consume my life
2014-04-29 14:47:11	wort	I need to figure out the best way to purge all of my old race tires.
2014-04-29 14:48:21	mikede__	Make them as planters for your garden?
2014-04-29 14:48:43	wort	hmm, maybe garden edging
2014-04-29 14:50:03	wort	probably not good edging for anything edible though
2014-04-29 14:50:39	tljohnsn	Fire at a tailgate?
2014-04-29 14:50:49	soehlert_	smell that burning rubber
2014-04-29 14:51:00	Jerknette	sorry folks, I was in a meeting...
2014-04-29 14:51:14	mikede__	Roast some marshmallows and get high?
2014-04-29 14:52:26	wort	Probably, who knows what crazy things are in those tires
2014-04-29 14:53:49	Jerknette	mikede__: Dop is a hoarder but not as bad as most hoarders.  eventually he lets me make him throw away stuff or throw away stuff on my own
2014-04-29 14:54:12	Jerknette	we had one box of crap sitting under his table for maybe four years before I make him empty it
2014-04-29 14:54:38	Jerknette	but he does need someone to tell him to throw something away
2014-04-29 14:54:50	Jerknette	he always thinks he'll have time to work on a project and it never gets done
2014-04-29 14:55:16	Jerknette	my next poke is to get him to get rid of his two bikes that he never uses and sell for cash in hand or buy a new bike that he might eventually use
2014-04-29 15:06:25	Dop2_	I won't get much out of them via sale, I'd just look to give them away.
2014-04-29 15:07:36	soehlert_	youd be surprised
2014-04-29 15:07:55	soehlert_	shitty old bicycles still go for like 50 60 bucks on craigslist in this town
2014-04-29 15:08:12	soehlert_	100 bucks gets you some nice booze
2014-04-29 15:15:24	Dop2_	but I could feel good about giving them to someone that otherwise couldn't afford it.
2014-04-29 15:16:19	soehlert_	also a fair point
2014-04-29 15:23:15	Dop2_	I just have to find those people without going to Craigslist and being all "are you poor and want a free bike?"  I don't want it to go to some shitball hipster.
2014-04-29 15:24:04	soehlert_	thats what i was wondering. how to vet this..
2014-04-29 15:24:34	soehlert_	http://thebikeproject.org/donate.html

2014-04-29 15:56:23	soehlert_	if you have a beer at piglet, will you even care if it rains a lil?

2014-05-01 13:50:24	Dop2_	my first concern would be college egos and cleanliness, but it depends how it's run.
2014-05-01 13:50:27	buraglio	it's gracie barra, which is kinda lame, but whatever.  it's a clean facility
2014-05-01 13:50:48	buraglio	it's *very* different than it was when that other dude ran it
2014-05-01 13:50:59	buraglio	I went in there a few times before and it was pretty lame
2014-05-01 13:51:09	buraglio	this guy is pretty serious.  It's his main job
2014-05-01 13:51:43	buraglio	it's still pricey, but I think I was just very spoild by the old pricing I had from 2002
2014-05-01 13:51:53	Dop2_	yeah, you were.  :)
2014-05-01 13:52:35	buraglio	he said I could do $125/mo for the afternoon classes and something on saturday which I'd never go to

2014-05-01 14:08:54	soehlert_	so i have to compare two syslog files from two machines (one is the forwarder and one is the end point). Only problem is the forwarder doesns't chop things up by hour and host, whereas end point does. Best way to go about it?
2014-05-01 14:15:44	Dop2_	fat guy in his 40s?  dark hair, maybe with a beard?

2014-05-01 14:39:00	kevN	Sounds good.
2014-05-01 14:39:01	Dop2_	and why can't he do that?
2014-05-01 14:39:17	kevN	I actually almost never used the scp remote binary to move files :)
2014-05-01 14:39:32	kevN	either rsynch or flat out tar.
2014-05-01 14:39:58	soehlert_	because the onus is on us to prove he's the one screwing up the formatting of the logs and not us
2014-05-01 14:39:59	kevN	tar czvpf - remotedir | ssh remote tar xczvf -
2014-05-01 14:40:04	soehlert_	kevN: no rsync binary either...
2014-05-01 14:40:13	kevN	use tar
2014-05-01 14:40:18	kevN	or cat if it's just 1 file.
2014-05-01 14:40:21	Dop2_	and is it syslog over UDP?  Cause I would expect them to not match.
2014-05-01 14:40:45	soehlert_	kevN: probably a good idea..i just installed scp and did my thing then removed it
2014-05-01 14:41:16	soehlert_	ya im expecting that too Dop2_ , but this is a "baseline" to see if its him or RSA screwing up the formatting. to be honest its a stupid contest for the ages.
2014-05-01 14:41:24	kevN	it's pretty crazy to delete scp's remote binary.
2014-05-01 14:41:28	Dop2_	Did he actually remove it or did the OS split that out into like ssh-utils or something stupid and it just wasn't installed?
2014-05-01 14:41:35	kevN	Who is the guy.. not melliot

2014-05-01 14:41:56	kevN	oh yeah, sounds like something that guy would do
2014-05-01 14:41:58	kevN	for "security"
2014-05-01 14:43:22	Dop2_	so you got me a pass for the 14th for 360 or what?

2014-05-01 14:43:39	kevN	so there's an email sent

2014-05-01 14:43:55	Dop2_	Just sign me up as a co-presenter and I wont' actually do anything.
2014-05-01 14:45:01	kevN	So do we have a range reserved for kevShoot
2014-05-01 14:45:11	kevN	Did you make target stands?
2014-05-01 14:46:01	Dop2_	it depends if we go to the range or out to Jan's place.
2014-05-01 14:46:10	kevN	http://accurateshooter.net/Blog/targstandplan.pdf
2014-05-01 14:46:15	kevN	Jan's place.
2014-05-01 14:46:23	kevN	Range is going to be on our ass
2014-05-01 14:46:32	Dop2_	At Jan's we have a railroad tie wall, but it needs a bit of repair.
2014-05-01 14:46:53	kevN	I expect all my ammo to be provided.
2014-05-01 14:47:01	Dop2_	I will have a shitton of 9mm.
2014-05-01 14:47:19	kevN	Who's shooting? You & trent?
2014-05-01 14:48:26	kevN	Josh?
2014-05-01 14:48:26	Dop2_	me, Trent at a minimum.  maybe Heather, AJ, Josh.
2014-05-01 14:48:26	Dop2_	need to check with Jan too.  :)
2014-05-01 14:48:27	kevN	lock it down.
2014-05-01 14:48:48	Dop2_	Berry.
2014-05-01 14:48:48	kevN	I'll work out a lesson plan.
2014-05-01 14:49:03	kevN	I asked about Josh before you sent it in my client
2014-05-01 14:49:08	kevN	I wasn't saying Josh who
2014-05-01 14:49:13	kevN	I was say is Josh free?
2014-05-01 14:49:17	Dop2_	weird.
2014-05-01 14:50:40	Dop2_	plan on doing that on Sunday.  Need to find out if Merk is going to Merk out or actually show up.
2014-05-01 15:05:46	Dop2_	oh snap!  My IL CCW application is status=Active.
2014-05-01 15:10:42	IcePick74	cool
2014-05-01 15:11:22	Dop2_	I think before it was pending.
2014-05-01 15:11:59	Dop2_	The biggest issue is where this is going to fit in my wallet.
2014-05-01 15:13:10	soehlert_	I really doubt you'll fit a gun in your wallet no matter how much you try
2014-05-01 15:13:20	IcePick74	it will be nice of they combine ccw and foid
2014-05-01 15:16:52	Dop2_	I'll get a George Castanza wallet.
2014-05-01 15:16:59	Dop2_	Yeah, that would be ideal, Icepick.
2014-05-01 15:17:18	Dop2_	or at least let the ccw fill that same role so you don't have to carry both (and the FOID is a requirement for it)

2014-05-02 09:49:58	soehlert_	I just think the job as the dude who rides around in a power boat all day and picks up basketballs sounds like one hell of a summer gig
2014-05-02 09:57:05	Jerknette	soehlert_: oh, so you're aiming lower :)  I'm sure you could do that job
2014-05-02 09:57:29	soehlert_	there are rumors that boat dude makes more than most everyone in this chat room..
2014-05-02 09:57:47	Jerknette	I have no doubt believing that
2014-05-02 10:07:13	Dop2_	I think I'd just buy more basketballs and only pretend like I was picking them up.
2014-05-02 10:07:42	soehlert_	well thats just cuz you're dumb and dont like boating
2014-05-02 10:17:53	Jerknette	Dop2_: no way, chances are a dead whale will wash up off the coast of California with a stomach filled with basketballs.  not worth the negative press
2014-05-02 10:19:06	mikede__	Wouldn't it be cheaper just to have a retractable net wall around the basketball court?

2014-05-02 11:37:56	buraglio	That sounds like a DHCP issue and not Meru
2014-05-02 11:38:09	buraglio	since Meru doesn't handle the DHCP leases, if memory serves
2014-05-02 11:44:23	soehlert_	idk they admitted to it being their bug to tboerner
2014-05-02 11:44:23	soehlert_	maybe i misunderstood sligthly, but the basic premise is meru fucked up and hands out the router address somewhere

2014-05-02 13:37:52	Dop2_	How do you feel about the amount of water herbs need compared to tomators.
2014-05-02 13:38:00	tljohnsn	I'd say that's doubtfull
2014-05-02 13:38:10	Dop2_	tomatoRs.  Man, that's the new awesome.
2014-05-02 13:38:16	tljohnsn	I just water everything the same
2014-05-02 13:38:33	tljohnsn	There's no way a pepper plant uses more water than a mature tomato
2014-05-02 13:38:40	tljohnsn	Just based on the size diff
2014-05-02 13:39:02	Dop2_	see.. that's what I was thinking.  Experience > Internet
2014-05-02 13:39:42	tljohnsn	Basically since your bed is raised, you can just not worry about it
2014-05-02 13:39:49	tljohnsn	If you over water, the soil will drain out.

2014-05-05 10:09:07	soehlert_	how was the class itself?

2014-05-05 10:39:58	WeeJay	soehlert_: the class was good but could have been better if there was more indepth coverage of Bro and Snort.  However, there was a lot of focus on manual analysis using protocol headers, bpf filters with byte offset etc.
2014-05-05 10:40:09	soehlert_	did they even get into bro?
2014-05-05 10:41:06	WeeJay	he kept emphasizing that he would never deploy bro by itself as IDS.  Only as a complimentary product to snort or another IDS. Whats your take on that?
2014-05-05 10:41:26	soehlert_	i think that's dumb
2014-05-05 10:41:46	soehlert_	we've just now found a need for running snort in addition to bro, and we've been running bro for like 10 years
2014-05-05 10:41:55	WeeJay	what is the need?
2014-05-05 10:42:44	soehlert_	all the zero day stuff gets released as snort rules...it's not worth the time and effort to translate them to bro language. if people just released them as both, we'd drop snort (well it's not installed yet, but you know what i mean)
2014-05-05 10:43:36	tljohnsn	Can the rules be automatically translated?
2014-05-05 10:43:52	soehlert_	nope
2014-05-05 10:44:03	soehlert_	though ive thought about making that a project of mine to see if i could pull it off.
2014-05-05 10:44:12	soehlert_	probably above my skill level though
2014-05-05 10:44:23	WeeJay	the brief time i spent with bro, it seemed it identifies traffic with a neutral stance...which is different than most IDS
2014-05-05 10:44:30	WeeJay	is that configurable in Bro?
2014-05-05 10:44:39	soehlert_	not sure i follow
2014-05-05 10:45:11	WeeJay	keep in mind i literally used Bro for like 15 mins....  bro did not necessarily flag a packet as good or bad
2014-05-05 10:45:39	WeeJay	it simply identified what application type it is, and if the protocol dissector is available, it extracts the stream
2014-05-05 10:45:47	soehlert_	bro definitely flags things as bad, if there's a policy to say "flag any packets like this bad"
2014-05-05 10:46:18	soehlert_	ya then there's userland policies that can decide if things are bad once they protocol has been analyzed/dissected
2014-05-05 10:46:32	WeeJay	OK so it is configurable.  I need to dive deeper into bro...i have a physical tap at home and i need to just build a box with the snort/bro etc.
2014-05-05 10:47:05	soehlert_	theres a bunch of policies by default installed (some may not be loaded) but it also has its own language so you can write your own policies
2014-05-05 10:50:42	Dop2__	I've been trying to listen to Freebird and have had to pause 3 times for phone calls.
2014-05-05 10:51:52	soehlert_	The 15 minute version?
2014-05-05 10:56:13	mikede__	Why can't you translate snort rules into bro rules?
2014-05-05 10:56:26	soehlert_	you can. it just takes time and effort.
2014-05-05 10:56:56	soehlert_	its a manual process. most of the time it would probably be quick, but just throwing up a snort box and using the snort rules is probably easier for one offs
2014-05-05 11:08:57	 *	buraglio yawns from Berkeley
2014-05-05 11:09:09	soehlert_	#humblebrag
2014-05-05 11:09:50	buraglio	is it that hard to translate rules?
2014-05-05 11:10:03	buraglio	can't you utilize snort rules right within bro?
2014-05-05 11:10:05	soehlert_	not hard really just takes time because its manual.
2014-05-05 11:10:13	soehlert_	no bro can't read snort rules. that would be cooll
2014-05-05 11:10:59	buraglio	I was pretty sure Bro could consume snort signatures
2014-05-05 11:11:09	buraglio	but my memory may be off
2014-05-05 11:11:26	soehlert_	i have never seen anyone do it and jazoff was the one suggesting we just run snort because of this. 
2014-05-05 11:11:32	buraglio	hmmm
2014-05-05 11:11:43	soehlert_	he's pretty in the know on bro so i am taking his word for it a bit.
2014-05-05 11:12:18	 *	soehlert_ asks seth
2014-05-05 11:12:43	buraglio	snort2bro was what I was thinking of but it looks depricated
2014-05-05 11:12:59	buraglio	The pattern matching in bro allows for similar behavior
2014-05-05 11:13:02	soehlert_	ya seth sides with me. 
2014-05-05 11:13:14	soehlert_	and ya that doesn't really work anymore and never worked well
2014-05-05 11:13:21	soehlert_	"there used to be a thing called snort2bro... that never worked right"
2014-05-05 11:13:29	buraglio	yeah, it kinda worked
2014-05-05 11:13:45	buraglio	if it were me I'd go woth surricata instead of snort
2014-05-05 11:14:01	WeeJay	buraglio: why surricata over snort?
2014-05-05 11:14:03	buraglio	I generally run both bro and surricata or snort
2014-05-05 11:14:06	soehlert_	well the whole reason is that most of these things get disseminated as snort rules
2014-05-05 11:14:09	buraglio	better ipv6 support
2014-05-05 11:14:15	WeeJay	meh
2014-05-05 11:14:15	soehlert_	if we're going to translate, we're going to do it to bro
2014-05-05 11:14:33	buraglio	bro and snort/surricata are too different to compare, rteally
2014-05-05 11:14:40	buraglio	don't"meh" me
2014-05-05 11:14:53	soehlert_	meh yes and no
2014-05-05 11:14:53	WeeJay	if IPV6 is the biggest selling point..it is a meh for me
2014-05-05 11:14:54	buraglio	if more people didn't "meh" ipv6 we wouldn't have the problems we had
2014-05-05 11:14:56	buraglio	have
2014-05-05 11:15:10	buraglio	it's more flexible
2014-05-05 11:15:24	buraglio	but whatever, go enjoy your boring enterprise world
2014-05-05 11:15:27	WeeJay	lol. we have been hearing about the demise of ipv4for like 10 years
2014-05-05 11:15:43	buraglio	yeah, morons keep layering NAT with reckless abandon
2014-05-05 11:15:58	buraglio	"lets paint over the rust just ONE more time"
2014-05-05 11:16:07	soehlert_	why not two?!
2014-05-05 11:17:38	buraglio	exactly
2014-05-05 11:18:04	 *	soehlert_ just wants buraglio to keep ranting
2014-05-05 11:18:19	WeeJay	is NCSA using all IPV6?
2014-05-05 11:18:33	soehlert_	hahahahaha
2014-05-05 11:19:14	WeeJay	any ipv6 use at all?
2014-05-05 11:19:28	soehlert_	very very few hosts are using it
2014-05-05 11:20:12	WeeJay	actually using it or just have ipv6 module enabled?
2014-05-05 11:20:45	soehlert_	actually requested an ipv6 address. we have some traffic on v6 but a very small amount last i checked
2014-05-05 12:05:40	buraglio	v6 got back burnered
2014-05-05 12:05:59	buraglio	the backbone was all v6 wuen I left, and the end user nets were ready with a few being enabled
2014-05-05 12:06:15	buraglio	it was blocking on the security guys, as usual.
2014-05-05 12:06:21	soehlert_	yup. its basically ready, just still making people actually request the ips (as far as i understand)
2014-05-05 12:06:39	soehlert_	we don't block things anymore buraglio, we were just fucking with you
2014-05-05 12:07:13	buraglio	this predated pretty much the entire current security team
2014-05-05 12:07:25	buraglio	the current NCSa security team is freaking top notch
2014-05-05 12:07:26	soehlert_	im aware. its just a long passed down secret
2014-05-05 12:07:38	soehlert_	woah. im gonna shut up now..
2014-05-05 12:07:47	buraglio	yeah, take the compliment.  I don;'t hand them out odften
2014-05-05 12:13:29	buraglio	my stance was to enable ipv6 on every end user net with the -M flag set
2014-05-05 12:13:48	buraglio	the issue was that dhcpv6 relay wasn't available on a *lot* of gear
2014-05-05 12:15:08	buraglio	it's available now

2014-05-06 13:33:38	mikede__	I thought you were a baller? Isn't $165 like five minutes of your time
2014-05-06 13:34:18	soehlert_	hahah you're funny
2014-05-06 13:34:41	soehlert_	im just amazed that that's the best he could do in louisville..i mean that can't be an expensive town right?
2014-05-06 13:36:04	tljohnsn	Why can't you just share rooms?
2014-05-06 13:37:01	mikede__	Maybe they are trying to hook up with some girls
2014-05-06 13:37:03	soehlert_	thats what im trying to do, otherwise this louisville trips is gonna be more expensive than montreal was even..
2014-05-06 13:37:22	soehlert_	i shared a room with 4 other dudes in montreal and that didnt stop me..
2014-05-06 13:38:08	soehlert_	granted it helped that she had her own room.
2014-05-06 14:10:52	Jerknette	sounds like you need to commit to hooking up with a girl who has her own room or share a room with one of your dude friends.  Otherwise you could hook up with a girl AND still pay to share a room you didn't use.  Which I guess isn't all that bad if you had a nice evening.
2014-05-06 14:15:24	soehlert_	ya im pushing for sharing rooms. im concerned though. looking at the website doesnt really show anything about how many beds and it seems to be a very strange hotel. more like b&b.
2014-05-06 14:15:43	Jerknette	I
2014-05-06 14:15:51	Jerknette	I've shared a bed with my girlfriends before
2014-05-06 14:17:30	tljohnsn	2 dudes can share a king - done that.
2014-05-06 14:21:32	soehlert_	oh absolutely we just did it in milwaukee. but it seems like singles based on the pictures. the website kinda sucks showing what all options. doesn't work like a hotel website at all
2014-05-06 14:30:58	mikede__	I picked up some tuna jerky this weekend. Pretty tasty. Weird. But tasty
2014-05-06 14:34:58	soehlert_	interesting. i would think tuna would be tough to jerk what with it falling apart and all. 
2014-05-06 14:35:53	Jerknette	mikede__: what about salmon jerky?  they make any of that out there?
2014-05-06 14:36:09	mikede__	Not sure
2014-05-06 14:36:13	mikede__	Tons of smoked salmon
2014-05-06 14:36:21	mikede__	But this is the first time I have ran into a fish jerky
2014-05-06 14:36:26	soehlert_	oh man i could just eat that stuff by the pound
2014-05-06 14:36:30	Jerknette	yeah, I'll have to try that some time
2014-05-06 14:36:46	Jerknette	is tuna considered an oily fish like salmon?
2014-05-06 14:36:48	soehlert_	Jerknette: maybe we could convince IcePick74 to try it sometime
2014-05-06 14:37:00	Jerknette	maybe that's why tuna can be jerkeyed and salmon isn't
2014-05-06 14:37:21	Jerknette	yeah, he'll get a box of it as a snack, :)
2014-05-06 14:46:40	mikede__	I was more thinking that tuna meat is different then salmon. You can make tuna steaks easily but not salmon steaks
2014-05-06 14:49:01	Dop2__	an tuna tastes better.
2014-05-06 14:52:30	soehlert_	Jerknette: I meant we can convince him to make it. He makes jerky. 
2014-05-06 14:52:52	Jerknette	oh yeah, that's a good idea, we should save him some extra money
2014-05-06 14:53:03	Jerknette	so he can spend it on other stuff ;)

2014-05-06 15:00:40	mikede__	Ugh what workout should I do today
2014-05-06 15:00:47	mikede__	It sucks not having a training plan
2014-05-06 15:01:15	soehlert_	where do you fall on crossfit?
2014-05-06 15:01:20	mikede__	?
2014-05-06 15:01:25	Jerknette	On Tuesdays I do Zumba and some work on the assisted pullup machine
2014-05-06 15:01:34	soehlert_	what are your feelings towards crossfit? are you pro or anti?
2014-05-06 15:01:45	mikede__	It can be good or it could be bad
2014-05-06 15:01:54	Jerknette	mikede__: don't do Zumba in regular shoes, you need to get dancing shoes with the pivot points in the sole
2014-05-06 15:01:55	mikede__	Depends on what your goals are, the quality of coaching, etc...
2014-05-06 15:01:57	soehlert_	woah. the rare middle ground crossfit guy
2014-05-06 15:02:20	soehlert_	i mostly hate it for the attitude of everyone i know that does it
2014-05-06 15:02:23	mikede__	I have been to some shit xfit boxes. I have been to some that are really really good
2014-05-06 15:02:40	mikede__	Yea, I don't get why people get so religious about it
2014-05-06 15:03:08	mikede__	If you want to be in pretty good shape with some strength and don't have a ton of time. Then I think crossfit is better than running for 30 minutes on the treadmill
2014-05-06 15:03:21	mikede__	If you want to be really strong or be good at o-lifting then xfit is bad
2014-05-06 15:03:22	kevN	1hr in on these headphones and I believe they're going back as not being all that comfy.
2014-05-06 15:03:33	mikede__	What headphones?
2014-05-06 15:03:38	kevN	Sennheiser Momentums.
2014-05-06 15:03:57	mikede__	They don't look comfy
2014-05-06 15:04:00	kevN	They kind of sit on the ear instead of over the ear if you get my drift.
2014-05-06 15:04:07	kevN	Any recommendations?
2014-05-06 15:04:21	kevN	$200 is my limit.
2014-05-06 15:04:22	mikede__	I got some sennheiser wireless ones and they are nice, except I think wireless are not that great
2014-05-06 15:04:26	mikede__	umm
2014-05-06 15:04:28	mikede__	Aren't you rich?

2014-05-06 15:05:20	kevN	I just think 200$ is a healthy budget for headphones.  But no, I'm not rich :)
2014-05-06 15:05:32	mikede__	uh-huh that is what a rich person would say

2014-05-06 15:06:03	soehlert_	kevN: I have Shure SRH440
2014-05-06 15:06:26	soehlert_	they are pretty awesome. especially if you get the 16 dollar ear cups that make them the same as the 840s. or you can just get the 840s i suppose
2014-05-06 15:06:32	mikede__	Jerknette: I don't think I will be doing Zumba anytime soon
2014-05-06 15:06:38	kevN	I will not own another shure product.
2014-05-06 15:06:59	Jerknette	oh come on!  it's so much fun! :)
2014-05-06 15:07:07	Jerknette	think of it as agility training
2014-05-06 15:07:09	kevN	I spent a lot of money on shure in-ear phones in the past and each set has blown up
2014-05-06 15:07:12	soehlert_	kevN: what happened with shure?
2014-05-06 15:07:23	mikede__	Jerknette: I am not sure how it can help me squat 400+
2014-05-06 15:07:27	soehlert_	ah sounds like some shitty luck but i get not wanting to back them then.
2014-05-06 15:07:30	kevN	like way before they should
2014-05-06 15:07:48	kevN	If in-ear buds blow up before I lose them, I have a problem.
2014-05-06 15:08:19	mikede__	I have a suggestion...turn down the volume
2014-05-06 15:08:23	soehlert_	haha true. those damn things are impossible to keep track of. thats why i usually buy the monoprice ones if im buying ear buds
2014-05-06 15:08:37	kevN	mikede__ I'm not a high-volume user.
2014-05-06 15:08:51	kevN	I didn't mean like a blew them out with loud volume
2014-05-06 15:08:52	mikede__	uh-huh
2014-05-06 15:08:54	mikede__	oh
2014-05-06 15:08:56	kevN	they just disintigrate in some way.
2014-05-06 15:08:59	mikede__	That sucks
2014-05-06 15:09:04	soehlert_	stop storing them in battery acid
2014-05-06 15:09:06	kevN	Cables on one set, the speaker on another
2014-05-06 15:09:14	mikede__	The coding horror article is pretty good
2014-05-06 15:09:15	tljohnsn	Acid in your ear wax?
2014-05-06 15:14:07	Dop2__	Bose QC15 headphones.  I won't go back and you can buy a cable that has a mic in it to do all your conf calls with them.
2014-05-06 15:15:12	kevN	Dop2__ above budget.
2014-05-06 15:16:28	Dop2__	it was above my budget too.
2014-05-06 15:16:49	tljohnsn	Dops have lasted a while, so perhaps if your other ones are failing, the extra $ is worth it.
2014-05-06 15:16:50	mikede__	If they last you 3-4 years it would be cheaper than buying multiple headphones
2014-05-06 15:17:05	Dop2__	I've even bought new foam ear pads they've lasted so long.
2014-05-06 15:17:13	Dop2__	I've had them since I was at NCSA.

2014-05-06 16:04:20	Jerknette	more for the way they feel on my head than the quality, there are good over the ear headphones that are less than Bose, the noise-cancellation is a plus but a heavy headphone will block out a lot of noise anyway
2014-05-06 16:05:04	soehlert_	oh ye of little head

2014-05-07 09:20:19	Jerknette	arrive June 26th

2014-05-07 09:48:52	mikede__	party party
2014-05-07 10:08:42	WeeJay	Jerknette: what you guys doing in seattle? vaca?
2014-05-07 10:09:12	Jerknette	yup, relax, eat good food, meet up with friends
2014-05-07 10:10:56	Jerknette	also taking a train up to Vancouver
2014-05-07 10:11:21	Jerknette	I should probably take my fancy camera
2014-05-07 10:17:13	mikede__	And they are also going to smoke a ton of fucking weed
2014-05-07 10:17:30	mikede__	:P
2014-05-07 10:22:57	soehlert_	i feel like Jerknette would be funny high. Dop2__ would just be lazy
2014-05-07 10:23:48	mikede__	*lazier
2014-05-07 10:23:59	soehlert_	fair point
2014-05-07 10:24:13	mikede__	I think Jerknette would be a person who ate a lot of food and was really chatty
2014-05-07 10:24:25	mikede__	Dop would be like "man I am just going to watch a movie"
2014-05-07 10:24:31	mikede__	Then again he might get the spins and puke
2014-05-07 10:24:35	soehlert_	haha thats exactly the picture in my head
2014-05-07 10:25:08	Jerknette	Dop said that he didn't notice much when he smoked pot, but he was already drunk, which could impact one's perception
2014-05-07 10:25:13	Jerknette	I've never smoked pot
2014-05-07 10:25:31	Jerknette	I might, in the future, if it became legal
2014-05-07 10:25:39	mikede__	It also depends on the strain of pot you had and how you consumed
2014-05-07 10:25:49	mikede__	Well it is legal in WA :)
2014-05-07 10:25:54	Jerknette	yeah, this was back in college, so who knows where it came from
2014-05-07 10:26:04	Jerknette	I'll have to think about it
2014-05-07 10:26:28	mikede__	I would probably go with edibles or vap if I had to do it now a days
2014-05-07 10:26:33	mikede__	err if I was to do it
2014-05-07 10:26:55	Jerknette	yeah, no one has to do anything ;)
2014-05-07 10:27:05	mikede__	They did in Swordfish!
2014-05-07 10:27:17	Jerknette	I heard that movie was terrible
2014-05-07 10:27:39	mikede__	It was pretty bad
2014-05-07 10:27:47	mikede__	Kind of like Hackers was bad but good at the same time
2014-05-07 10:27:58	Jerknette	oh yeah, Hackers was awesome
2014-05-07 10:28:08	soehlert_	my roommate couldn't believe that was angelina jolie
2014-05-07 10:28:24	Jerknette	what?  who else looks like her?
2014-05-07 10:28:28	Jerknette	she has a very unique face
2014-05-07 10:28:38	Jerknette	and other features
2014-05-07 10:28:45	soehlert_	well he just saw a poster or something for it
2014-05-07 10:28:55	Jerknette	oh, yeah, her wig was terrible
2014-05-07 10:28:59	soehlert_	but she does look a little different...especially with that really short hair
2014-05-07 10:29:11	soehlert_	was that a wig? didn't she just rock the short hair then?
2014-05-07 10:29:23	Jerknette	seemed like a wig to me, brb
2014-05-07 10:31:15	Jerknette	yeah, I guess you're right
2014-05-07 10:31:21	Jerknette	it looked fake to me in the poster
2014-05-07 10:31:32	soehlert_	of course im right
2014-05-07 10:42:54	WeeJay	mstanislav: do you guys support AWS integration for MFA?

2014-05-07 12:18:26	Jerknette	ha!
2014-05-07 12:18:47	soehlert_	i unabashedly love about 90% of those songs
2014-05-07 12:19:15	Jerknette	yeah, I was going to say I think I know and like all of these songs (except for the PJ ones, of course)
2014-05-07 12:19:31	soehlert_	obviously.
2014-05-07 12:19:57	soehlert_	i feel like you need to watch PJ20. If you still dislike pearl jam after that i will stop giving you crap
2014-05-07 12:20:11	Jerknette	is that a movie?
2014-05-07 12:20:16	soehlert_	documentary
2014-05-07 12:20:50	Jerknette	I like music documentaries, the one of the Eagles made me tolerate Joe Walsh
2014-05-07 12:21:06	Jerknette	Don Henley takes himself waaaaaaay too seriously
2014-05-07 12:21:20	soehlert_	The man that gave us Funk 49 deserves more than toleration
2014-05-07 12:21:20	soehlert_	also, "Those Shoes" just came on my shuffled library...literally listening right now
2014-05-07 12:22:19	Jerknette	ha
2014-05-07 12:23:20	Jerknette	you know what really sucks?  new Eagles music
2014-05-07 12:23:46	Jerknette	I use that adjective loosely, "new" goes back up to 20 years

2014-05-07 12:31:26	mostlybadfly	also can i just say it disgusts me you're being nostalgic for 90s music, i'm still remembering some 80s stuff :P
2014-05-07 12:31:40	soehlert_	oh i can get nostalgic for 80s music too
2014-05-07 12:32:06	soehlert_	i used to walk around in my when i was like 4 screaming pour some sugar on me...
2014-05-07 12:32:09	mostlybadfly	i feel like the 90s were more ridiculous
2014-05-07 12:32:10	Jerknette	he was a big fan of Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative"
2014-05-07 12:32:26	mostlybadfly	like there were some good things in the 80s but 90s had a new level of showiness and tackyness
2014-05-07 12:32:32	Jerknette	soehlert_: added PJ20 to my netflix queue NOW GET OFF MY BACK
2014-05-07 12:32:34	soehlert_	ummm hair bands

2014-05-07 12:32:53	mostlybadfly	what is that?
2014-05-07 12:32:56	soehlert_	showiness&tackyness = hair bands
2014-05-07 12:33:02	soehlert_	mbf: its a pearl jam documentary
2014-05-07 12:33:04	mostlybadfly	oh
2014-05-07 12:33:12	Jerknette	I don't like Pearl Jam
2014-05-07 12:33:21	mostlybadfly	there are a lot of rock bands i didn't listen to that drew has to explain to me
2014-05-07 12:33:22	Jerknette	well, I don't dislike them
2014-05-07 12:33:32	Jerknette	does he mansplain it?
2014-05-07 12:33:33	Jerknette	;)

2014-05-07 12:33:50	mostlybadfly	he doesn't get why i dont know who led zeppelin is
2014-05-07 12:33:57	mostlybadfly	and i'm like check your privilege booboo
2014-05-07 12:33:59	Jerknette	it's not really an explanation, it's more of a condescention
2014-05-07 12:34:23	Jerknette	(but srsly you should listen to some Led Zeppelin)
2014-05-07 12:34:35	mostlybadfly	i've learned about some stuff since dating him
2014-05-07 12:34:42	mostlybadfly	but it's not in my realm of interest
2014-05-07 12:34:56	Jerknette	I have to say, Dop hasn't bent in my musical direction either
2014-05-07 12:34:59	mostlybadfly	i like it but i dont feel lconnected to it like he does
2014-05-07 12:35:04	Jerknette	he won't even see Minus the Bear with me in Seattle

2014-05-07 12:35:30	soehlert_	Minus the Bear + Seattle...could you be more stereotypical?
2014-05-07 12:35:38	Jerknette	oh yeah, I know

2014-05-07 12:36:06	soehlert_	i really wish someone wanted to go to Indy to see reignwolf with me saturday though..
2014-05-07 12:36:21	mostlybadfly	i really wish someone wanted to go to Indy
2014-05-07 12:36:22	Jerknette	I don't know reignwolf
2014-05-07 12:36:25	mostlybadfly	not really
2014-05-07 12:36:43	soehlert_	he's kinda small but he's so much awesomeness. just some good ole fashioned rock
2014-05-07 12:36:55	soehlert_	only better and sometimes he plays drums while singing and playing some crazy guitar
2014-05-07 12:36:55	soehlert_	lots of energy
2014-05-07 12:37:03	mostlybadfly	we missed out on QOTSA here :(
2014-05-07 12:37:11	mostlybadfly	but it's at Aragon and I dont like that place
2014-05-07 12:37:15	soehlert_	sold out?
2014-05-07 12:37:15	soehlert_	cuz im seeing them there
2014-05-07 12:37:21	mostlybadfly	probably
2014-05-07 12:37:27	mostlybadfly	but i dont go to Aragon
2014-05-07 12:37:38	soehlert_	stub hub that shit. we can go grab drinks/food before/after
2014-05-07 12:37:40	mostlybadfly	i dont get why they get such great bands
2014-05-07 12:38:04	soehlert_	its a famous old place to play
2014-05-07 12:38:10	mostlybadfly	you should hit us up anyway, we live like a 15 min walk from there
2014-05-07 12:38:13	soehlert_	ive never been but i heard its pretty well set up for musical acts too
2014-05-07 12:38:31	soehlert_	i dont think i have either of your numbers...its just me and one other buddy going so i could probably make something happen
2014-05-07 12:39:12	Jerknette	so did you get someone to watch your dogs, soehlert_ ?
2014-05-07 12:39:17	soehlert_	ya im covered
2014-05-07 12:39:21	soehlert_	thanks 
2014-05-07 12:40:15	mostlybadfly	surprise Jerknette , it's you!
2014-05-07 12:40:47	mostlybadfly	omg http://i.imgur.com/KbpCt8w.gif
2014-05-07 12:40:57	Jerknette	ha, I offered, but also disclosed that I know nothing about dogs :)
2014-05-07 12:41:07	soehlert_	they have four legs and a tail. 
2014-05-07 12:41:19	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: OMG! indeed
2014-05-07 12:41:38	mostlybadfly	dogs are easy
2014-05-07 12:41:45	mostlybadfly	you just give them hugs and food
2014-05-07 12:41:47	mostlybadfly	and they're happy
2014-05-07 12:41:57	Jerknette	soehlert_: going back to music, I listened to a cattle decapitation song in honor of Jon Schipp, I would not say that it's my kind of music
2014-05-07 12:42:09	mostlybadfly	oh guys
2014-05-07 12:42:15	mostlybadfly	Future Islands, listen to them
2014-05-07 12:42:18	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: it's more knowing when to send them out to pee and stuff
2014-05-07 12:42:20	mostlybadfly	great throwback synth pop
2014-05-07 12:42:46	soehlert_	Jerknette: i listeed to their first song. it was like 2 minutes of music without lyrics and i was like "ok i can dig this" then the "singer" came in and i didn't last 10 seconds
2014-05-07 12:42:58	mostlybadfly	http://youtu.be/1Ee4bfu_t3c this guy is quite the performer, i really like the song
2014-05-07 12:43:11	soehlert_	Jerknette: usually how i take care of the dogs is leave the patio door open, sit on my recliner, drink beer and watch tv.
2014-05-07 12:43:23	soehlert_	thats what i expect out of my dogsitter as well...well and feed them twice i guess
2014-05-07 12:43:27	mostlybadfly	Jerknette: you just do it every 3-4 hours.  at least that's Porter's schedule.  and he also needs to go out when he's being a pain in the ass
2014-05-07 12:44:53	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: I'm listening to their Seasons video now, subtitled (Waiting on You), which should be the story of me and Dop, I can't leave the house because he won't put on his shoes.
2014-05-07 12:45:04	mostlybadfly	hahahaha
2014-05-07 12:45:10	mostlybadfly	drew drags to leave to i dont get it
2014-05-07 12:45:16	mostlybadfly	i'm like why aren't we leaving 5 min ago
2014-05-07 12:45:49	mostlybadfly	he puts on his shoes the last thing and i'm like sitting there watching him put on his shoes every time
2014-05-07 12:46:15	Dop2__	Drew = Jeannette
2014-05-07 12:46:22	mostlybadfly	lol
2014-05-07 12:46:36	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: yeah he has some good moves
2014-05-07 12:46:37	Dop2__	When I said we were going to leave in 5 min I meant leave, not... finally go get ready.
2014-05-07 12:46:48	mostlybadfly	is Jerknette the one that has you waiting on her vs her waiting on you Dop2__ ?
2014-05-07 12:46:54	Jerknette	NO!
2014-05-07 12:47:04	Jerknette	For years I've been waiting on Dop
2014-05-07 12:47:09	Dop2__	oh please.
2014-05-07 12:47:15	mostlybadfly	if drew is ready before me, he'll find something else to do until i'm waiting for himk
2014-05-07 12:47:18	soehlert_	maybe he's not late, he's just really early for the next thing
2014-05-07 12:47:23	Jerknette	so much so that I give myself activities at the last minute because I know he's going to have to poop or something
2014-05-07 12:47:50	mostlybadfly	oh so he ends up waiting for you then
2014-05-07 12:47:54	Jerknette	lately I have been slacking a little and get ready once he says he's ready
2014-05-07 12:48:12	Jerknette	yes, the last few times it's been that way; I'll just get ready sooner and ride his ass
2014-05-07 12:48:18	mostlybadfly	i get pissed waiting, it drives me nuts
2014-05-07 12:48:29	mostlybadfly	my dad is the same way
2014-05-07 12:48:31	Dop2__	she also takes forever to get out of the car.
2014-05-07 12:48:44	mostlybadfly	ugh stop
2014-05-07 12:48:44	Jerknette	I get really pissed when dinner is served and he has his nose in his laptop
2014-05-07 12:48:45	mostlybadfly	lol
2014-05-07 12:49:06	mostlybadfly	Jerknette: yuuuuuuup.  i say dinner is ready and start eating, fuck it
2014-05-07 12:49:32	Jerknette	grilled cheese loses it's crust, like 15 seconds after it hits the plate, amirite?
2014-05-07 12:49:33	mostlybadfly	i'm hungry, not trying to wait for someone else's schedule, especially when they're just online
2014-05-07 12:49:46	Jerknette	*its, not it's
2014-05-07 12:50:15	soehlert_	*tits
2014-05-07 12:50:39	Jerknette	it only takes me forever to get out of the car because I have to carry Dop's shit too
2014-05-07 12:51:04	Jerknette	when I pack light with just a phone and a wallet I bust out of there like I'm running away from my bookie
2014-05-07 12:51:41	Dop2__	lies
2014-05-07 12:51:52	Jerknette	really?
2014-05-07 12:52:11	Jerknette	because who carries Pepcid AC? Ibuprofen?  Tooth floss?
2014-05-07 12:52:22	Jerknette	Kleenexes?
2014-05-07 12:53:14	soehlert_	maybe you shouldn't be 90 and need those things anytime you leave the house
2014-05-07 12:54:04	mostlybadfly	one thing i dont get is how people take forever to get stuff out of their bag
2014-05-07 12:54:13	mostlybadfly	like at my job our door is locked and you need your key fob to open it
2014-05-07 12:54:25	mostlybadfly	so why do people figure out they're going to work right when they're at the door
2014-05-07 12:54:30	mostlybadfly	and drag
2014-05-07 12:55:17	mostlybadfly	then you get the entitled trixie chick that stops looking because they see you coming up with your fob in hand
2014-05-07 12:55:31	soehlert_	open the door, but close her out
2014-05-07 12:57:24	mostlybadfly	I've tried
2014-05-07 13:00:01	Dop2__	OMG, this Smart Art thing is the WORST
2014-05-07 13:01:36	buraglio_	?
2014-05-07 13:03:44	Dop2__	upper mgmt sent some template to fill out and you can't move any of the objects around cause it's all some smart thing.
2014-05-07 13:16:14	Jerknette	I carry two sets of keys
2014-05-07 13:16:24	Jerknette	one for my house/car and one for the office
2014-05-07 13:17:07	Jerknette	I don't like a giant bundle of keys in my pocket, so when I get out of the car I switch keys as I'm walking into the office
2014-05-07 13:24:05	buraglio_	Jerknette: I do the same thing
2014-05-07 13:31:57	Dop2__	I re-keyed the office so they're the same.
2014-05-07 13:40:36	soehlert_	jerknette and mbf, last night i made some chicken with a walnut/honey/molasses simmer sauce. ooo man
2014-05-07 13:44:55	Jerknette	roughly chopped walnuts?  or superfine dice?  sounds good
2014-05-07 13:45:16	Jerknette	Dop2__: f you, seriously ;)
2014-05-07 13:45:23	Jerknette	I'm not rekeying my office door
2014-05-07 13:51:32	soehlert_	roughly chopped. it was pretty great. im happy too because i made it up on the spot
2014-05-07 14:37:51	mostlybadfly	Sounds good
2014-05-07 14:44:15	Jerknette	oh yeah, soehlert_ , speaking of on the spot, your beer was great
2014-05-07 14:44:22	Jerknette	the mixture worked
2014-05-07 14:44:37	soehlert_	sweet glad you liked it. i thought it came out a little weak, but tasty enough
2014-05-07 14:44:58	Jerknette	near beer?
2014-05-07 14:45:08	soehlert_	well i mean it was still 4.7% 
2014-05-07 14:45:17	soehlert_	but i think it woulda been better stronger
2014-05-07 14:45:23	Jerknette	ah
2014-05-07 14:53:20	soehlert_	Dop2__: what am i supposed to talk about this evening?
2014-05-07 14:53:57	Jerknette	soehlert_: Dop might not be coming out
2014-05-07 14:54:02	soehlert_	laaame
2014-05-07 14:54:06	Jerknette	i know
2014-05-07 14:54:12	soehlert_	porque?
2014-05-07 14:54:15	Jerknette	but he needs to work on the irrigation system
2014-05-07 14:54:39	Jerknette	it's only half done and you know how he doesn't like to get up early in the morning, especially for chores(watering the plants)
2014-05-07 14:55:10	Jerknette	Dop2__: will you ask Trent to bring me a mug?
2014-05-07 15:00:02	Jerknette	soehlert_: sent.
2014-05-07 15:00:30	soehlert_	bipolar? really living up to that name there...
2014-05-07 15:00:56	Jerknette	bipolar, having two extremes: good music and terrible music
2014-05-07 15:01:05	soehlert_	examples of both please

2014-05-07 15:12:49	Jerknette	soehlert_: let's burn whatever delicate, popsicle stick, bridge we had: where do you stand with Rush?
2014-05-07 15:13:21	mikede__	Fucking Candians
2014-05-07 15:13:23	soehlert_	overrated. not terrible but they're not on any sort of altar
2014-05-07 15:13:30	Jerknette	okay
2014-05-07 15:13:40	mikede__	*canadians
2014-05-07 15:13:59	Jerknette	I can't stand them, but I won't burn the bridge yet
2014-05-07 15:14:17	mikede__	Where do you stand on Foo Fighters?
2014-05-07 15:14:33	soehlert_	Jerknette: I really only like one or two songs by them. But it's tough to hate on Neil Peart
2014-05-07 15:14:33	soehlert_	mikede__: not sure if you're messing with me
2014-05-07 15:14:40	soehlert_	Foo Fighters are one of my favorites
2014-05-07 15:14:50	mikede__	Jerknette: I am surprised you guys didn't come out at the end of July so you could see Beyonce and Jay-Z
2014-05-07 15:15:12	Dop2__	that would have at least been entertaining.
2014-05-07 15:15:14	Dop2__	BOOM
2014-05-07 15:15:46	mikede__	If Dop2__ would have let you spend the coin Jerknette you could have gone with my better half and her cousin
2014-05-07 15:16:00	Jerknette	mikede__: I like Beyonce, but not enough to see a concert
2014-05-07 15:16:10	Jerknette	I don't own a complete album of hers, only singles
2014-05-07 15:16:20	mikede__	I am surprised by this
2014-05-07 15:16:27	soehlert_	make that two of us
2014-05-07 15:16:28	mikede__	I feel like you should be a closet pop fan
2014-05-07 15:16:38	Jerknette	I am a pop fan
2014-05-07 15:17:45	Jerknette	but not enough to go to pop concerts, or rather not enough to go to the concerts of the most pop-y stars of the pop I like
2014-05-07 15:18:19	mikede__	Geez
2014-05-07 15:19:17	Jerknette	but I love Beyonce's voice, she is definitely Whitney Houston's replacement, hands down
2014-05-07 15:20:00	Jerknette	I like Katy Perry in spite of myself, that's why pop music is so effective
2014-05-07 15:20:44	wort	Current outdoor temp = 90
2014-05-07 15:20:48	Dop2__	I think my new plan is a couple beers at happy hour before going to Lowes and working on stuff.
2014-05-07 15:20:55	Jerknette	the lyrics to Dark Horse make no sense, what she's describing is not really a dark horse, it's more like being hunted by a love monster, but whatever, it's catchy
2014-05-07 15:20:58	mikede__	I see only half of that plan happening
2014-05-07 15:20:59	Dop2__	Trent's not even here.
2014-05-07 15:21:18	soehlert_	wheres trent?
2014-05-07 15:22:02	Dop2__	last I heard, selling Junkyard pinball at home.
2014-05-07 15:22:34	mikede__	I hate haircuts, but I have to look good for my Google interview next week
2014-05-07 15:22:47	soehlert_	new job or consulting?
2014-05-07 15:22:57	mikede__	New job
2014-05-07 15:23:13	soehlert_	Trying to leave or a good opportunity popped up?
2014-05-07 15:23:21	wort	Nice Mike
2014-05-07 15:23:21	mikede__	I can't work with Dop2 any more
2014-05-07 15:23:27	soehlert_	makes sense
2014-05-07 15:23:32	mikede__	I am joking
2014-05-07 15:24:00	Jerknette	mikede__: have you seen "Silicon Valley" yet?
2014-05-07 15:24:13	soehlert_	I'm hooked
2014-05-07 15:24:39	Jerknette	I'm just thinking how mikede__ would fair at Hoolie (sp?)
2014-05-07 15:24:48	soehlert_	hahah
2014-05-07 15:24:53	soehlert_	and I think it's Hooli
2014-05-07 15:24:59	Dop2__	I need a haircut.
2014-05-07 15:25:14	Dop2__	mike wouldn't be a Pied Piper?
2014-05-07 15:25:24	mikede__	I have been to SV
2014-05-07 15:25:34	mikede__	I am not a huge fan of start-ups they always feel like college dorms
2014-05-07 15:25:44	Jerknette	yeah, it's hooli
2014-05-07 15:25:46	Dop2__	they smell like febreeze?
2014-05-07 15:25:47	Jerknette	had to look it up
2014-05-07 15:26:00	soehlert_	someday you'll learn not to doubt me
2014-05-07 15:26:03	mikede__	And people cook for you and do your laundry
2014-05-07 15:26:07	mikede__	And your office is always messy
2014-05-07 15:26:15	mikede__	And there are boys sleeping on couches
2014-05-07 15:26:21	mikede__	Now that I think about it Dop would probably love that shit
2014-05-07 15:26:25	Jerknette	:)
2014-05-07 15:26:29	Jerknette	he worked for a start up
2014-05-07 15:26:31	soehlert_	except they make you do work
2014-05-07 15:26:39	mikede__	No a real start-up in SV
2014-05-07 15:26:43	Dop2__	I loved the early days of it.
2014-05-07 15:26:45	mikede__	Plus that was like 15 years ago
2014-05-07 15:26:49	mikede__	It is different now
2014-05-07 15:26:54	Dop2__	and it was 13 years ago.  :)
2014-05-07 15:27:00	mikede__	same diff
2014-05-07 15:27:10	soehlert_	be older
2014-05-07 15:27:35	mikede__	That is one thing I don't get at the bank. There are no morale events.
2014-05-07 15:27:46	Dop2__	ha.
2014-05-07 15:27:47	mikede__	I hate the f'ing name but doing fun stuff as a group always made sense to me
2014-05-07 15:27:47	Dop2__	Get this.
2014-05-07 15:28:00	Jerknette	mikede__: wouldn't be at Pied Piper, but his dry sense of humor would be perfect at that place
2014-05-07 15:28:17	Dop2__	I got an email today from the appreciation site reminding me it's an employee's work anniversary and I should consider mentioning it to them.
2014-05-07 15:28:18	mikede__	I have a sense of humor?
2014-05-07 15:28:30	mikede__	go bank
2014-05-07 15:28:40	mikede__	"You have survived this hell for 3 years, good job!"
2014-05-07 15:28:51	Dop2__	"You should fake appreciate people."
2014-05-07 15:29:07	Jerknette	mikede__: I thought you had a sense of humor, maybe I just have gas
2014-05-07 15:29:26	mikede__	I am not sure, ask other people. I suck at judging myself
2014-05-07 15:29:32	Jerknette	Dop2__: awkwardly pat your employee on the back
2014-05-07 15:29:41	mikede__	Do more of a caress
2014-05-07 15:30:03	Jerknette	but make it awkward
2014-05-07 15:31:40	Jerknette	when I was still at Wolfram and the ice cream place was open during the summer season we'd go there for "team building exercises"
2014-05-07 15:31:53	soehlert_	ice cream place meaning custard cup?
2014-05-07 15:31:55	Jerknette	I even put it on the calendar
2014-05-07 15:32:05	Jerknette	yeah, but mikede__ doesn't know the custard cup
2014-05-07 15:32:15	soehlert_	well right i was asking for my own benefit
2014-05-07 15:32:21	Jerknette	oh, yeah
2014-05-07 15:32:26	Jerknette	that place is great
2014-05-07 15:32:45	soehlert_	we should make an NCSA thing to go there and not work some afternoon
2014-05-07 15:32:59	Jerknette	1 scoop chocolate custard with butterscotch topping, pecans, whipped cream, and a cherry on top
2014-05-07 15:33:09	Jerknette	fine by me

2014-05-08 11:29:33	soehlert_	just to clarify WeeJay, DCCP module is not loaded by default in RHEL either
2014-05-08 11:41:53	WeeJay	soehlert_: yup
2014-05-08 11:42:11	WeeJay	some admin implied it was built in which is why it send me down the goose chase
2014-05-08 11:42:31	WeeJay	i knew it sounded too strange for RH to do something like that for a fairly new proto
2014-05-08 11:42:33	soehlert_	ya and you saying it wasnt loaded by default in centOS made me think you meant it was in RHEL so i looked more into it
2014-05-08 11:42:51	soehlert_	although it is loaded automatically on one host of ours somehow..
2014-05-08 12:23:31	mostlybadfly	mmmm lunch

2014-05-08 15:28:16	Dop2__	and he's got such a lead in Settlers he can just not play and maintain a lead.
2014-05-08 15:28:22	soehlert_	tljohnsn: do you have an office at home?
2014-05-08 15:28:48	kevN	Dop2__ : are we working from the office on Monday morning?
2014-05-08 15:29:07	tljohnsn	Yes, I just got a new desk for my home office
2014-05-08 15:29:12	kevN	I need to work on my 360 slides.
2014-05-08 15:29:35	tljohnsn	It's one that can transition between sit and stand modes.
2014-05-08 15:29:47	kevN	ooh la la
2014-05-08 15:29:59	soehlert_	nice
2014-05-08 15:30:16	tljohnsn	The old one was too low so my knees would hurt after using it after an hour or so.
2014-05-08 15:34:13	mikede__	tljohnsn: what desk did you get?
2014-05-08 15:34:35	tljohnsn	http://www.ergodepot.com/Jarvis_Desk_p/jrv.htm
2014-05-08 15:35:03	kevN	You should have bought Mike's desk off of Craigslist.
2014-05-08 15:35:04	mikede__	nice
2014-05-08 15:35:38	tljohnsn	Didn't know he had a desk for sale
2014-05-08 15:35:41	Jerknette	you guys noticed ever since Trent got his new desk he's been so stuck up on himself
2014-05-08 15:35:47	tljohnsn	Haha
2014-05-08 15:37:31	tljohnsn	I did keep the drawer part of my old desk to use for files.  Cut that part off with a sawzall so it looks a bit janky.
2014-05-08 15:39:12	Jerknette	Why didn't you buy yourself one of those file drawers on casters?
2014-05-08 15:39:16	Jerknette	castors?
2014-05-08 15:39:43	soehlert_	ya why dont you get your work catered?
2014-05-08 15:39:54	tljohnsn	Heather volunteered for that task, but did not complete it, so I came up with my own solution.
2014-05-08 15:40:14	tljohnsn	But that was the original plan.
2014-05-08 15:40:20	Jerknette	:)
2014-05-08 15:42:42	mikede__	When I get my office back I might have to check out those desks
2014-05-08 15:46:11	Jerknette	mikede__: when are you getting your office back?
2014-05-08 15:46:19	mikede__	Not for a long time
2014-05-08 15:46:32	mikede__	When you guys are up here you will see my small ass house
2014-05-08 15:46:34	tljohnsn	Baby take over your office?
2014-05-08 15:47:26	mikede__	Just moving back into my house in Seattle and it only has two "bedrooms" (one is a converted back porch). The house is only 900 square feet so....
2014-05-08 15:47:39	Jerknette	holy shit
2014-05-08 15:48:38	mikede__	Need to save up some coin to either add in two floors and/or build a garage with a guest room / office on top of it
2014-05-08 15:48:48	mikede__	So not for awhile :)
2014-05-08 15:49:01	Jerknette	not interested in selling?
2014-05-08 15:49:07	Jerknette	do you own it already?
2014-05-08 15:49:33	tljohnsn	Jerknette: I am eating the last of your "crack"ers
2014-05-08 15:49:48	Jerknette	I was thinking about making more this weekend, too soon?
2014-05-08 15:49:52	mikede__	We "own" it. But you can't get into my neighborhood there is no stock. If a house is for sell it is 650k+
2014-05-08 15:50:28	tljohnsn	Anyone have amy whelply's contact info?
2014-05-08 15:50:34	Jerknette	I can see how you'd want to put money into it, but two floors is not cheap
2014-05-08 15:50:52	mikede__	Dump 250k+ get 250k+ out of it right away
2014-05-08 15:51:06	mikede__	Or more
2014-05-08 15:51:17	mikede__	But yea it is not cheap
2014-05-08 15:54:32	Jerknette	this house sounds like a retirement fund :)

2014-05-09 12:40:01	mostlybadfly	beards make up for everything

2014-05-09 12:42:44	mikede__	Yea it was already on our short-list of things to fix
2014-05-09 12:42:59	soehlert_	well thats a positive
2014-05-09 12:42:59	soehlert_	at least it wasn't an unexpected upgrde
2014-05-09 12:43:30	Jerknette	mikede__: yes, your beard makes up for you being a pain in the ass
2014-05-09 12:46:36	mikede__	Better grow one then I guess
2014-05-09 12:46:50	soehlert_	you don't have a beard?? ughh...

2014-05-09 12:49:57	mikede__	She would probably attack me with clippers if I tried to grow it out
2014-05-09 12:49:59	mostlybadfly	drew had a goatee when we first started dating and I was like you need to either grow a beard or shave it

2014-05-09 12:54:30	mostlybadfly	i thought you had a lady
2014-05-09 12:54:50	soehlert_	it'll probably be a lot of dont care because im too lazy to shave and look twelve when im clean shaven

2014-05-09 13:12:40	mostlybadfly	I dont like them that close or groomed but still cool
2014-05-09 13:18:37	Dop2__	jesus, I still need a haircut.
2014-05-09 13:19:44	mostlybadfly	What would Jerknette do if you came back from the barber with your beard shaved off Dop2__?
2014-05-09 13:20:32	Jerknette	he did it once
2014-05-09 13:20:34	mostlybadfly	My dad messed up his mustache trim and had to shave it off. My mom almost cried
2014-05-09 13:20:35	Jerknette	it didn't go well
2014-05-09 13:21:22	Jerknette	Dop trimmed a straight bar down the center of his chin when he went to the ICP Gathering back in 2002
2014-05-09 13:21:47	Jerknette	he had to shave off his chin beard and start over, he hasn't been beardless since, from when I can remember
2014-05-09 13:22:28	Dop2__	I'd shave my head before I shaved my beard.
2014-05-09 13:29:40	mikede__	I have been tempted to come home with a mohawk when I go get a haircut
2014-05-09 13:53:49	mikede__	I love how teams always like to say "yea we know it all and we are experts!!!!"
2014-05-09 13:56:28	mikede__	"Yea we are a team of know it alls"

2014-05-13 11:11:20	Jerknette	did you talk about your stocks and retirement plans?
2014-05-13 11:11:36	Dop2__	no, was I supposed to?
2014-05-13 11:11:56	Jerknette	no,
2014-05-13 11:12:24	Jerknette	I'm thinking about what kind of boring conversation a couple old dudes have at a hotel bar at 11pm
2014-05-13 11:12:52	Jerknette	In my head you're also smoking cigars
2014-05-13 12:21:06	mikede__	That is something I would talk about
2014-05-13 12:21:11	mikede__	And Dop you weren't up that late :P
2014-05-13 12:21:33	mikede__	Oh wait Dop2__ doesn't drink coffee, yea never mind, that would suck
2014-05-13 12:22:03	wort	haha

2014-05-13 12:29:26	Jerknette	mikede__: Dop2__ still drinks coffee, but not as much
2014-05-13 12:30:11	Jerknette	oh man
2014-05-13 12:30:15	Jerknette	I ate too much!
2014-05-13 12:30:31	soehlert_	whatd you have?
2014-05-13 12:32:53	Jerknette	soehlert_: sliced potatoes topped with caramelized onions and bacon, and cucumber yogurt
2014-05-13 12:33:14	Jerknette	which is shredded and drained cucumber mixed with yogurt and a little salt & pepper
2014-05-13 12:33:33	soehlert_	wow going all out
2014-05-13 12:33:46	Jerknette	all homemade
2014-05-13 12:34:45	Jerknette	it's probably the volume equivalent of a baked potato and Wendy's chili
2014-05-13 12:34:56	Jerknette	except it's not also pumped with garbage
2014-05-13 12:35:15	soehlert_	but thats the best part!
2014-05-13 12:36:44	Jerknette	I'm going to need a walk
2014-05-13 12:36:49	Jerknette	in a bit
2014-05-13 12:37:02	Jerknette	it hurts too much right now
2014-05-13 12:39:52	buraglio	Jerknette: Any chance for remote access to bro workshop?
2014-05-13 12:40:12	Jerknette	don't think so, we're recording the talks
2014-05-13 12:40:14	buraglio	ESnet has folks that can pay to attend but can't easily travel
2014-05-13 12:40:25	Jerknette	I can ask Adam
2014-05-13 12:40:30	buraglio	please do
2014-05-13 12:42:08	Jerknette	sent.
2014-05-13 12:42:14	Jerknette	he's doing some fancy BW thing today
2014-05-13 12:42:23	buraglio	pinky up
2014-05-13 12:42:31	Jerknette	they are at the iHotel
2014-05-13 12:42:39	Jerknette	I told him I could just walk into the hotel if I wanted
2014-05-13 12:42:55	buraglio	heh
2014-05-13 12:43:38	Jerknette	he said that if they give him a polo and it's not sweat wicking he's going to throw it back in their face and say, "I'm John Malchai.  Go f*ck yourself!"
2014-05-13 12:44:36	buraglio	ha
2014-05-13 12:44:50	buraglio	I prefer to wear cotten and be super sweaty
2014-05-13 12:45:00	buraglio	touching and rubbing on everyone
2014-05-13 12:45:14	Jerknette	Adam wants to look like a golfer but has no interest in golfing
2014-05-13 12:45:33	Jerknette	so you wanna know how I know it's humid?
2014-05-13 12:45:36	buraglio	golf is almost as boring as football
2014-05-13 12:45:49	Jerknette	my forearms get super sweaty
2014-05-13 12:46:01	Jerknette	golf is the worst
2014-05-13 12:46:44	soehlert_	whats wrong with being outside, getting drunk, and driving a golf cart around? you guys are wrong
2014-05-13 12:47:01	buraglio	the sport part of it is too slow
2014-05-13 12:47:04	Jerknette	I did that on Bald Head Island, I didn't have to play golf like an ahole
2014-05-13 12:47:18	soehlert_	just because youre bad at something is no reason to trash it
2014-05-13 12:47:20	buraglio	and why do I need to play golf to do any or all of those things
2014-05-13 12:47:22	buraglio	?
2014-05-13 12:47:32	soehlert_	because all of those things are fun when its nice out
2014-05-13 12:47:38	buraglio	first off, I'm fucking great at everything
2014-05-13 12:47:43	soehlert_	thats a lie
2014-05-13 12:47:51	buraglio	prove it
2014-05-13 12:47:57	soehlert_	lets go golfing
2014-05-13 12:48:19	soehlert_	or how about soccer?
2014-05-13 12:48:26	buraglio	you figure out how to carve 6 hours of time out for me to go and I'll be happy to beat you at golf
2014-05-13 12:48:48	soehlert_	apparently carving out 6 hours (wouldn't take me 6 to play...) is also something youre bad at
2014-05-13 12:49:06	buraglio	not something I'm bad at, it's just non-trivial
2014-05-13 12:49:30	soehlert_	im surprised admitting defeat is non trivial for you. doesn't seem like you
2014-05-13 12:49:47	buraglio	i admit nothing
2014-05-13 12:49:58	soehlert_	its cool you dont have to. we can all read for ourselves
2014-05-13 12:50:03	Jerknette	isn't admitting nothing still admitting something?
2014-05-13 12:50:05	buraglio	heh
2014-05-13 12:50:38	buraglio	I take it back, I'm not good at having tiny, tine hands
2014-05-13 12:50:47	buraglio	tiny*
2014-05-13 12:51:03	buraglio	also I'm apparently not good at preventing typos
2014-05-13 12:51:57	soehlert_	or being aware of the size of people's hands
2014-05-13 12:57:54	buraglio	na, I think I'm demonstrably good at that.
2014-05-13 13:07:55	Jerknette	buraglio: soehlert_ does have tiny, tine hands.  like the tines of a tiny fork
2014-05-13 13:08:35	buraglio	indeed
2014-05-13 13:08:38	Jerknette	you could use his hands to skewer a cocktail meatball
2014-05-13 13:41:46	mikede__	This is a bizarre conversation..
2014-05-13 13:43:22	mikede__	I just went to a Texas sushi bar. The rolls were silly huge.
2014-05-13 13:43:33	soehlert_	everythings bigger..
2014-05-13 13:44:57	mikede__	The point of sushi is not too have huge fucking pieces of rolls....
2014-05-13 13:45:07	mikede__	But hey the Texans liked it lol
2014-05-13 13:45:21	soehlert_	im just surprised you can get sushi there
2014-05-13 13:47:29	mikede__	It is decent
2014-05-13 13:47:34	mikede__	They fly the stuff in and such
2014-05-13 13:47:47	mikede__	But fish here in general is usually shit
2014-05-13 13:48:12	wort	Same deal here.  Although the sushi is usually smaller at least.
2014-05-13 13:48:34	Jerknette	wait a second.  texas mike is back in texas?
2014-05-13 13:48:37	mikede__	This is the first Dallas sushi place I have been to that was like that
2014-05-13 13:48:42	mikede__	Just for a few days
2014-05-13 13:48:47	mikede__	Job interview and such
2014-05-13 13:48:50	Jerknette	ah
2014-05-13 13:49:04	mikede__	!really
2014-05-13 13:49:19	Jerknette	I figured
2014-05-13 13:49:37	Jerknette	I don't take your job related stuff too seriously, you hold your cards too close to your chest
2014-05-13 13:50:39	mikede__	Who knows maybe I am being truthful!
2014-05-13 13:50:44	mikede__	I did LOVE Dallas sooo much
2014-05-13 13:52:04	mikede__	The beer selection has gotten better down here though
2014-05-13 13:53:40	wort	More than just Lone Star now?
2014-05-13 13:54:42	mikede__	And Shiner
2014-05-13 13:54:50	mikede__	Yea there are some solid craft brews and such
2014-05-13 13:59:01	wort	nice
2014-05-13 14:00:53	Jerknette	mikede__: what do you have against Shiner?  I like their smoked beer, I think it's a summer seasonal
2014-05-13 14:01:22	soehlert_	probably that its just that and lone star in many parts of Tejas
2014-05-13 14:01:22	soehlert_	but their grapefruit is pretty solid summer beer to
2014-05-13 14:02:17	Jerknette	Yeah, I've had that too
2014-05-13 14:08:06	mikede__	Yea shiner isn't horribl
2014-05-13 14:12:18	soehlert_	anyone know why JetBlue would have this as a password requirement? Cannot contain a Q or Z
2014-05-13 14:16:36	buraglio	weird?
2014-05-13 14:16:48	soehlert_	ya i just cant come up with a good reason for it..
2014-05-13 14:16:57	Jerknette	I'm trying to think of the most offensive password with a z and a q right now
2014-05-13 14:17:08	buraglio	quiz?
2014-05-13 14:23:57	mikede__	probably related to the password being translated to a phone pad
2014-05-13 14:24:47	Jerknette	I see q and z on my phone pad
2014-05-13 14:25:04	Jerknette	are you saying the makers of my microsoft lync phone are lying to me
2014-05-13 14:25:38	mikede__	No phones used to not have a q and a z
2014-05-13 14:25:43	mikede__	*No, phones...
2014-05-13 14:27:27	mikede__	That is why the q & z buttons (7 & 9) have four characters
2014-05-13 14:27:27	mikede__	http://www.dialabc.com/motion/keypads.html
2014-05-13 14:27:42	mikede__	Get off my lawn
2014-05-13 14:28:06	soehlert_	so that would suggest people type in their passwords on their dumbphones?
2014-05-13 14:28:16	soehlert_	like this is a problem for JetBlue?
2014-05-13 14:28:49	mikede__	A bunch of companies translate your password to phone digits
2014-05-13 14:29:00	mikede__	Fidelity used to do it (not sure if they still do it)
2014-05-13 14:29:15	mikede__	blah blah blah
2014-05-13 14:30:51	Jerknette	but why translate the PW into phone digits?
2014-05-13 14:31:13	Jerknette	how will they know that 2 means b and not c?
2014-05-13 14:33:06	mikede__	It makes the passwords weaker
2014-05-13 14:33:11	mikede__	Case also goes out the window
2014-05-13 14:33:19	mikede__	Along with special characters
2014-05-13 14:33:56	Jerknette	but isn't that bad to make the passwords weaker?  I'm still catching onto this whole security thing
2014-05-13 14:34:41	mikede__	Yes, yes it is
2014-05-13 14:35:15	mikede__	Just most stuff is so insecure I have become jaded/cynical and most of the time I am just like "eh"
2014-05-13 14:35:22	wort	I'd guess they do it so that you can type your password in over the phone for whatever reason.
2014-05-13 14:36:23	Jerknette	they could issue extra special security pins for those people
2014-05-13 14:36:38	soehlert_	that's money
2014-05-13 14:37:15	Jerknette	far better to save money now and clean up the security mess later, I think that's what Target learned from their recent mess
2014-05-13 14:37:24	mikede__	But yes it is dumb how many places have password restrictions
2014-05-13 14:37:34	mikede__	And Neiman Marcus
2014-05-13 14:37:39	mikede__	Oh wait.. no they didn't
2014-05-13 14:37:49	mikede__	TJ Maxx didn't get hurt too bad :P
2014-05-13 14:38:20	Jerknette	De de de de, de de de de TJ MAXX!!!!

2014-05-14 11:53:34	WeeJay	thanks Jerknette
2014-05-14 13:04:12	Dop2__	I can chat now, what's up?
2014-05-14 13:27:15	WeeJay	hey you know of a way to disable TLS1.1, 1.2 in RHEL?
2014-05-14 13:27:23	WeeJay	in the openssl package without recompiling
2014-05-14 13:40:27	Dop2__	shouldn't that be at the app level?  like, in Apache, not OpenSSL
2014-05-14 13:41:05	WeeJay	There is no openssl tool that restricts the protocol version at the library level
2014-05-14 13:42:34	mikede__	http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CONF_cmd.html ???
2014-05-14 13:43:15	WeeJay	i saw that but that looked like at an api level ...but i am not trying to do this at an app level.
2014-05-14 13:48:02	mikede__	Looks like you have to recompile
2014-05-14 13:48:50	WeeJay	yeah i was trying to keep TLS1.0 but remove 1.1, 1.2 and that looks difficult
2014-05-14 14:04:34	mostlybadfly	mikede__: speaking of I have a question related to rails setup
2014-05-14 14:04:51	mostlybadfly	If I may
2014-05-14 14:07:01	mostlybadfly	I installed it using rvm.  I did "\ curl -sSL http://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails"
2014-05-14 14:07:15	mostlybadfly	But this tutorial is saying I need to point rvm to openssl. Created a gemset and install yaml
2014-05-14 14:07:29	mostlybadfly	Does doing the --rails tag do this basically? Because I'm up and running
2014-05-14 14:46:04	mikede__	Any tutorial over six months to a year old in rails or node is probably out of date and inaccurate
2014-05-14 14:56:44	mostlybadfly	Hmmm ok
2014-05-14 14:57:06	mostlybadfly	So how do you recommend setting up rails?
2014-05-14 14:57:45	mostlybadfly	Just follow the rvm.io instructions ?
2014-05-14 15:38:54	mikede__	pretty much
2014-05-14 15:39:21	mikede__	Also - http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

2014-05-14 15:54:02	mostlybadfly	Cool thanks
2014-05-14 15:55:28	mostlybadfly	So why rvm vs just gem install rails
2014-05-14 15:55:49	mostlybadfly	Shouldn't the guide have this method if it's preferable?
2014-05-14 16:32:00	WeeJay	mikede__ Dop2__ i got a weird openssl issue
2014-05-14 16:32:33	WeeJay	i have a server which offers tlsv1 when i connect using centos5 but only sslv3 when connecting using centos6 with the latest openssl release
2014-05-14 16:33:04	WeeJay	which means my centos6 client is not advertising tlsv1 capability??

2014-05-14 21:49:04	mikede__	rvm is nice but not required and makes life a little more complex
2014-05-14 21:49:45	mikede__	RVM is very useful in the sense that you can manage multiple ruby versions and updating is a bit easier
2014-05-14 21:49:54	mikede__	But it adds some overhead as well

2014-05-15 10:19:50	Jerknette	totally got to shut someone down for asking if UIUC employees get a discount
2014-05-15 10:19:56	Jerknette	NOPE!
2014-05-15 10:20:30	Jerknette	which reminds me buraglio: we're working to get you an answer about getting access to a web broadcast of BroCon '14
2014-05-15 10:20:33	Jerknette	(tm)
2014-05-15 10:21:51	soehlert_	you didnt get a discount
2014-05-15 10:21:55	soehlert_	?
2014-05-15 10:23:34	Jerknette	I got in for free
2014-05-15 10:23:43	soehlert_	where at?
2014-05-15 10:23:49	Jerknette	anyone on the project got in for free
2014-05-15 10:24:03	Jerknette	I don't know the person asking me so I'm assuming he doesn't get in for free
2014-05-15 10:25:26	Jerknette	besides, the cost is for covering food
2014-05-15 10:25:44	Jerknette	which I don't think we should spend time running the numbers if we offer discounts for some but not all
2014-05-15 10:45:31	soehlert_	im so confused because i read your thing wrong. i thought you said you got shut down for a discount and i had no idea for what
2014-05-15 10:46:02	Jerknette	yeah, I should have mentioned earlier it was BroCon related

2014-05-15 10:54:20	soehlert_	I would suggest reading the rest of this away from work, but this one is SFW

2014-05-15 12:22:41	WeeJay	mikede__: Dop2__ so turns out the ssl handshake issue has to do with a poor implementation of custom ssl stack in the product
2014-05-15 12:23:35	soehlert_	custom ssl? yayyyy
2014-05-15 12:23:44	WeeJay	which is why an older ssl client was able to negotiate tls1 but the newer one could not negotiate tal1,1.1,1.2 ..only sslv3
2014-05-15 12:24:04	WeeJay	yeah who the fuck implements custom ssl stack...turns out products which are like 10-15 yrs old
2014-05-15 12:24:34	mikede__	Good times
2014-05-15 12:24:39	soehlert_	reinventing the wheel is *always* the best way to go
2014-05-15 12:24:46	mikede__	Software products never die, they just frustrate their users
2014-05-15 12:25:01	mikede__	15 years ago a solid SSL stack library didn't exist...
2014-05-15 12:25:15	 *	soehlert_ shows his age
2014-05-15 12:25:28	mikede__	Shows you weren't a geek 15 years ago
2014-05-15 12:26:14	soehlert_	I think I was first introduced to oregon trail about 15 years ago. my first "geeky" thing
2014-05-15 12:27:12	WeeJay	fortunately we slapped a apache proxy in front of this shitty product to deal with it
2014-05-15 12:28:17	mikede__	Nice :)
2014-05-15 12:28:43	mikede__	Were you in third grade 15 years ago soehlert_
2014-05-15 12:33:27	WeeJay	ok turns out older client ssl handshake was 121 bytes
2014-05-15 12:33:32	WeeJay	the new one is 263 bytes
2014-05-15 12:33:40	WeeJay	so the old ssl stack is freaking out and dropping it
2014-05-15 12:33:48	mikede__	I wonder if there was a security bug in there :)
2014-05-15 12:34:08	wort	Quite likely.
2014-05-15 12:34:12	mikede__	Sounds like it

2014-05-20 13:42:14	mikede__	The Ballard one is solid but small
2014-05-20 13:42:30	Jerknette	I'm okay with that
2014-05-20 13:42:41	Jerknette	less for me to carry back to the hotel
2014-05-20 13:42:42	mikede__	Less of a chance for Dop to complain
2014-05-20 13:43:58	mikede__	But you guys might get there after it closes
2014-05-20 13:44:05	mikede__	Not sure when you plan on rolling in
2014-05-20 13:48:32	Dop2__	we get in on June 26th.
2014-05-20 13:48:41	Dop2__	Ballard on the 28th.
2014-05-20 13:49:29	Jerknette	hey mikede__ do you know anything about REST APIs?
2014-05-20 13:49:38	Jerknette	or does someone else here know about REST APIs?
2014-05-20 13:49:58	mikede__	I know a bit
2014-05-20 13:50:02	mikede__	What do you need to know
2014-05-20 13:50:12	mikede__	Ahh ok on the 29th is farmer's market so perfect
2014-05-20 13:50:20	Jerknette	my friend is trying to learn about them for her job, she's a SugarCRM admin at Wolfram
2014-05-20 13:50:29	mikede__	Ok...
2014-05-20 13:50:35	Jerknette	she wanted to know if anyone had any resources to point her to
2014-05-20 13:50:43	Jerknette	"no buzz words" she said :)
2014-05-20 13:52:07	mikede__	REST isn't really crazy
2014-05-20 13:52:18	mikede__	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#Applied_to_web_services
2014-05-20 14:29:42	soehlert_	Jerknette: you may not wanna do this to yourself, but jazoff is really good with them if you wanna bug someone else
2014-05-20 14:30:06	Jerknette	I'll ask, thanks

2014-05-21 13:25:54	mikede__	I must be getting old it took me awhile to find some real malware scripts
2014-05-21 13:26:18	soehlert_	find anything fun?
2014-05-21 13:26:31	mikede__	Yea found a few
2014-05-21 13:26:48	mikede__	Nothing "new" but it was hard to find valid downloads that weren't umm... odd
2014-05-21 13:27:22	tljohnsn	This laptop thinks everything I try to download is malware.
2014-05-21 13:27:29	mikede__	Bank laptop?
2014-05-21 13:27:35	tljohnsn	Yep...
2014-05-21 13:27:49	mikede__	Exhibit #1827 why I never fucking use the bank's laptop
2014-05-21 13:28:07	tljohnsn	Need to print with word and I don't have it elsewhere
2014-05-21 13:28:17	tljohnsn	Printer driver is "malware"
2014-05-21 13:28:21	mikede__	lol
2014-05-21 13:28:28	soehlert_	haha
2014-05-21 13:28:31	tljohnsn	So xfering with a memory stick.
2014-05-21 13:28:36	mikede__	Drop $99 on office for the home and be done with it
2014-05-21 13:28:47	mikede__	Wait? You can plug a memory stick into your laptop?
2014-05-21 13:28:57	mikede__	I thought they turned that off
2014-05-21 13:29:01	tljohnsn	Yeah, it worked just fine.
2014-05-21 13:29:08	mikede__	Nice
2014-05-21 13:29:08	tljohnsn	Don't tell anyone
2014-05-21 13:29:11	mikede__	I bet it won't soon
2014-05-21 13:34:00	tljohnsn	FYI, chrome was also flagged as malware
2014-05-21 13:34:14	mikede__	EVERYTHING IS MALWARE!!!!
2014-05-21 13:34:39	soehlert_	guys we should probably stop using IRC. its pretty clearly malware
2014-05-21 13:46:13	mikede__	Fer shizzle
2014-05-21 13:46:54	mikede__	This one malware encodes itself three times and then re-encoded itself about four times so there was roughly ~12 encodings in it
2014-05-21 13:46:57	mikede__	Kind of cute
2014-05-21 13:47:26	soehlert_	i think we've seen something like that here long ago. in fact i think dop wrote a program to decode it repeatedly until you got to the start
2014-05-21 13:47:46	mikede__	Yea it is pretty common
2014-05-21 13:47:50	mikede__	Just funny

2014-05-22 13:30:19	Jerknette	shit
2014-05-22 13:30:21	soehlert_	kids are the worst
2014-05-22 13:30:45	Jerknette	hey mikede__ good post, a couple of news sites have covered that book, I listened to an interview of the author as well
2014-05-22 13:32:24	Jerknette	parents often complain about how busy they are, but that's also because they overschedule their kids, which is a newer phenomenon as well
2014-05-22 13:44:49	mikede__	for sure Jerknette
2014-05-22 13:45:45	mikede__	We are all responsible for how "busy" we are. blah blah blah
2014-05-22 13:47:16	Jerknette	my former boss at Wolfram was the worst offender, she has three boys, all three are in sports year round, she manages getting them off to school and primarily manages sending them to practice... she was always running to place to place like a chicken with her head cut off
2014-05-22 13:48:23	mikede__	*sigh*
2014-05-22 13:48:58	mikede__	If the kids are older they should be responsible for getting to and from practice
2014-05-22 13:49:00	mikede__	imho
2014-05-22 13:49:29	Jerknette	we don't let kids be by themselves anymore
2014-05-22 13:49:31	mikede__	From what I have seen of that book mentioned in those articles she blames men for why women feel overwhelmed, which is umm... silly
2014-05-22 13:50:38	Jerknette	I think if most relationships follow traditional roles and traditional breakdowns of work then the wife takes on more of the housework
2014-05-22 13:50:50	Jerknette	traditionally speaking
2014-05-22 13:51:41	mikede__	Sure, but if a women is working then the load should be distributed but I think women feel pressured to do both. Which the husband (or whoever is not sharing the load) should work on correcting
2014-05-22 13:53:34	Jerknette	some husbands are harder to get on board than others, case in point: I was sick of Dop taking the change out of his pocket and leaving it wherever he found it, I started putting change jars at every major station where he sits or cleans out his pockets, I still found change less than a foot from the change jar
2014-05-22 13:54:06	mikede__	Yep. As I say you can't change another person but only hope that they will change and help them when they want.
2014-05-22 13:54:08	Jerknette	he wants to put his change away, he really feels that putting change jars near him is a logical solution, it's just that he can't remember to put the change in the jar... or so he says
2014-05-22 13:56:14	Dop2__	you can't change how I deal with change!!!
2014-05-22 13:56:45	Jerknette	or when you take off your socks and leave them under the coffee table
2014-05-22 14:00:52	tljohnsn	I love the answer in the ethics training, when rich shows up to work hung over.
2014-05-22 14:01:11	tljohnsn	Joe should bring Rich some black coffee and an asprin
2014-05-22 14:02:37	Jerknette	yeah, is Joe a team player or a whining baby?
2014-05-22 14:05:41	tljohnsn	He seems like a team player - I'd bring him the coffee.
2014-05-22 14:14:19	mikede__	I also like how you are not supposed to give your fellow employees $50 or more
2014-05-22 14:14:40	Jerknette	for what?
2014-05-22 14:15:05	Jerknette	I think we need to understand what services/objects are acceptable and what are not
2014-05-22 14:15:19	soehlert_	you should know this as you had to take ethics training
2014-05-22 14:26:03	IcePick741	http://cam.illinois.edu/
2014-05-22 14:26:57	Jerknette	oh I didn't pay attention :P
2014-05-22 14:27:24	Jerknette	that way when I get pulled in for ethics violation I have plausible deniability, I can pin it all on Adam
2014-05-22 14:28:49	soehlert_	actually pretty sure you waived that whole thing..
2014-05-22 14:29:01	soehlert_	you have to say i fully read and understood etc yada whatever something
2014-05-22 15:18:14	mikede__	Jerknette: my point about blaming men though is it is like blaming a race or sexual preference for a problem. Part of the problem lies with the partner. But part of the problem lies with the person, they don't have to say "yes" all the time.

2014-05-23 07:37:14	mostlybadfly	Check your key privilege
2014-05-23 07:44:07	Jerknette	mikede__: I'm not blaming men, there's a lot of data to backup the imbalance of housework among male-female couples, there may be an imbalance among gay couples but it will probably take some time for those studies to come out because there is decades-long research into this topic
2014-05-23 07:45:25	Jerknette	and good morning :)
2014-05-23 07:48:19	mostlybadfly	Usually when gays fall into those roles we call it heteronormative
2014-05-23 07:48:42	mostlybadfly	Just adding input lol
2014-05-23 07:50:59	mostlybadfly	I don't think she should blame men but I think you can point to a male dominated society
2014-05-23 07:53:24	mostlybadfly	Men do benefit from certain implied roles in society
2014-05-23 08:36:52	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: & mikede__ I think one of the biggest improvements Dop and I have done for our marriage is to hire a house cleaner :) farm the work out and save your marriage!  (not to say that it was that bad)
2014-05-23 08:42:27	mostlybadfly	Is your housekeeper a woman??!!!
2014-05-23 08:42:51	Jerknette	yup, so we haven't done much to correct the balance
2014-05-23 08:42:59	Jerknette	or rather, imbalance
2014-05-23 08:53:39	mostlybadfly	I was just kidding hehe

2014-05-23 10:02:58	mikede__	And yes housecleaners rock
2014-05-23 10:28:31	tljohnsn	is it worth $8 for me to play a catan tournament at gencon?
2014-05-23 10:28:41	mostlybadfly	Yes
2014-05-23 10:29:41	soehlert_	probably because i wanna hear about what thats like
2014-05-23 10:34:30	Dop2__	is it like an all day event?
2014-05-23 10:34:47	tljohnsn	You play until you lose...
2014-05-23 10:35:06	tljohnsn	So, I don't really feel like playing settlers all day...
2014-05-23 10:35:21	tljohnsn	But also am curious to see what it's like.
2014-05-23 10:39:49	soehlert_	http://blog.lessthan3.com/2014/05/deadmau5-tweets-motivational-posters/
2014-05-23 10:46:58	buraglio	you should let random homeless people pee on you, it'd probably be more fun than a full day of that game
2014-05-23 10:48:03	buraglio	OH!, or you could watch zombocom! http://www.zombo.com/ It's almost certainly more entertaining
2014-05-23 10:52:03	buraglio	soehlert_: that comedy poster is fantastic
2014-05-23 11:03:28	soehlert_	I kinda wanna hang some up in my office and see how long it takes someone to realize
2014-05-23 11:39:30	buraglio	DO IT

2014-05-27 09:54:29	soehlert_	guess you'll be walking to work
2014-05-27 10:14:19	Dop2__	apparently the cops at the train station are dicks about it too.
2014-05-27 11:12:20	Jerknette	?
2014-05-27 11:12:22	Jerknette	Dop2__:
2014-05-27 11:12:29	Jerknette	what took you so long to renew?
2014-05-27 11:12:37	soehlert_	hint: he's lazy
2014-05-27 11:20:45	Jerknette	soehlert_: I know.  It's important for him to admit it so he will do more to prevent lazy Dop from winning.  Planning ahead Dop has to step up
2014-05-27 11:23:52	mikede__	Is there a planning ahead Dop?
2014-05-27 11:24:14	Jerknette	yes, deep down
2014-05-27 11:24:19	Jerknette	way down
2014-05-27 11:26:59	mikede__	So so deep
2014-05-27 11:28:21	mikede__	Looks like I get to see Dop twice in one month. I feel like a fight might occur
2014-05-27 11:28:26	mikede__	I would lose though
2014-05-27 11:28:58	soehlert_	Why are you gonna fight Dop?
2014-05-27 11:29:12	mikede__	I am pretty annoying so Dop might get fed up

2014-05-27 12:21:53	mostlybadfly	happy post memorial day
2014-05-27 12:52:23	Jerknette	mikede__: you aren't the first to say that
2014-05-27 12:52:39	Jerknette	our friend Jayk thinks he can take Dop too, so does our brother in law
2014-05-27 12:52:50	Jerknette	but they admit that they are just telling themselves that
2014-05-27 12:54:20	Jerknette	you can't take Dop2__
2014-05-27 12:54:33	Jerknette	you might sucker punch him, but in a man:man brawl you'll lose
2014-05-27 12:54:37	Jerknette	he's just too good now
2014-05-27 12:55:09	soehlert_	Jerknette: how is it "our brother in law"
2014-05-27 12:55:26	soehlert_	like someone's sister's husband?
2014-05-27 12:55:54	Jerknette	Dop's sister's husband
2014-05-27 12:56:04	Jerknette	in the context of speaking of me and Dop, "our brother in law" is Laura's husband
2014-05-27 12:56:06	soehlert_	gotcha.
2014-05-27 12:56:30	Jerknette	I think Dustin still sees Dop as the skinny college kid
2014-05-27 12:57:15	soehlert_	oh so now Dop2__ is fat??? wowwww..really livin up to that name Jerknette 
2014-05-27 12:57:33	Jerknette	putting words in my mouth
2014-05-27 12:57:42	soehlert_	:)
2014-05-27 12:57:57	Jerknette	impressive because I'm eating lunch so I'm busy shoving food into my mouth
2014-05-27 12:59:25	soehlert_	i should eat
2014-05-27 12:59:45	mikede__	I only joke about taking Dop
2014-05-27 13:00:03	Jerknette	I know
2014-05-27 13:00:31	mikede__	I think I could make it so we would have a stalemate though, it would just take me a little bit
2014-05-27 13:01:07	Jerknette	mikede__: do you have any martial arts or boxing training?
2014-05-27 13:01:39	mikede__	I have some from back in the day
2014-05-27 13:02:01	mikede__	Get a two years of grappling training plus gain about 30 pounds of muscle and Dop would have to work for it
2014-05-27 13:02:20	mikede__	*maybe
2014-05-27 13:02:44	soehlert_	id just keep running away until he was tired from chasing me
2014-05-27 13:02:53	Jerknette	I'm asking because training breaks you of bad habits people fall into when they don't train
2014-05-27 13:03:02	mikede__	For sure
2014-05-27 13:03:43	Jerknette	and, because he's a younger blackbelt, he's always sparing with people better than him
2014-05-27 13:05:28	mikede__	Yep
2014-05-27 13:05:57	mikede__	I have no doubts I would win. The goal would be to make it hard / make it a stalemate
2014-05-27 13:06:11	mikede__	Dop knows he doesn't have endurance so it would just be a matter of running the clock down
2014-05-27 13:14:14	wort_	Rope-a-Dop?
2014-05-27 13:20:20	mikede__	I will just make Dop wear an 80 pound weight vest. Then have him run half a mile. Then fight him
2014-05-27 13:20:25	mikede__	He would still win though
2014-05-27 13:20:26	mikede__	lol
2014-05-27 13:21:13	Jerknette	he's good at making like a sloth once he's found a comfortable spot, to conserve his energy
2014-05-27 13:21:21	mikede__	Yea
2014-05-27 13:21:31	mikede__	But I don't think he would last the run
2014-05-27 13:22:12	mikede__	Most people wouldn't be in good shape after that
2014-05-27 13:22:39	mikede__	Auditing flash script is horrid
2014-05-27 13:24:06	soehlert_	that reminds me...maggie ran a 5k fully rucked out. by choice.
2014-05-27 13:24:13	mikede__	Nice :)
2014-05-27 13:24:35	soehlert_	i feel like the ruck was unnecessary, but whatever works i suppose
2014-05-27 13:24:48	mikede__	Yea
2014-05-27 13:24:56	mikede__	I want to do some of the goruck challenges they look fun
2014-05-27 13:25:08	soehlert_	never heard of it.
2014-05-27 13:25:34	mikede__	https://www.goruck.com/challenge#.U4TYmJRdXM4
2014-05-27 13:26:41	soehlert_	teams?
2014-05-27 13:26:44	mikede__	Do that then heavy
2014-05-27 13:26:53	mikede__	You do it with a group yea
2014-05-27 13:27:55	soehlert_	as in one ruck sack and the group switches who carries it but everyone does the whole distance? or everyone does a chunk
2014-05-27 13:28:18	mikede__	Everyone does the whole distance
2014-05-27 13:28:24	mikede__	And chunk
2014-05-27 13:28:37	mikede__	It is basically normal people military training and shit
2014-05-27 13:28:57	soehlert_	ahhh gotcha. so the group thing isn't to physically make it easier. not like a relay race or something
2014-05-27 13:29:25	mikede__	Yea
2014-05-27 13:42:16	Jerknette	how much does a ruck sack weigh?
2014-05-27 13:42:50	soehlert_	in the military it varies greatly. Usually at least 50lbs though..
2014-05-27 13:43:12	Jerknette	5K run + 50 lbs = no thank you
2014-05-27 13:43:36	Jerknette	I could probably walk it
2014-05-27 13:43:40	mikede__	Only a little over 2 miles, easy peesy :)
2014-05-27 13:43:42	mikede__	lol
2014-05-27 13:43:47	soehlert_	3 miles
2014-05-27 13:44:01	Jerknette	a little over 2 miles could be 3 miles
2014-05-27 13:44:01	soehlert_	3.12 exactly
2014-05-27 13:44:01	soehlert_	but also she didnt "run" it either. 38 mins or something
2014-05-27 13:44:04	Jerknette	give or take ;)
2014-05-27 13:44:13	mikede__	ah
2014-05-27 13:44:18	mikede__	Fast walk
2014-05-27 13:44:56	soehlert_	yes and no. shed probably run one in the mid to upper 20s anyways
2014-05-27 13:47:15	mikede__	Ah cool cool
2014-05-27 14:16:04	mikede__	Was she dead after it?
2014-05-27 14:16:10	mikede__	aka really tired
2014-05-27 14:23:44	soehlert_	idk havent talked to her about it post race
2014-05-27 14:40:53	mostlybadfly	What is run
2014-05-27 14:41:50	soehlert_	oh man that made me think of rum, which made me think of a dark and stormy which made me think of this drink i had this weekend. Bourbon/Kentucky Mule: 2oz bourbon, Ginger beer to fill up cup, squirt a bit of lime juice in there.
2014-05-27 14:42:06	mostlybadfly	Yeah those are good
2014-05-27 14:42:14	mostlybadfly	I like it with rye
2014-05-27 14:43:55	soehlert_	I'll have to give that a go
2014-05-27 14:44:37	mostlybadfly	You better
2014-05-27 14:44:49	soehlert_	I also tried a drink with spiced rum, coconut rum, cachaca, and coke. can't remember the name. very delicious. 5 shots in one drink also makes for quick drinkin
2014-05-27 14:45:15	mostlybadfly	Yeah well it's like 90% sugar so I bet it's good
2014-05-27 14:45:35	mostlybadfly	I made 90% of that number up
2014-05-27 14:45:39	soehlert_	ya pretty sweet, but really interesting booze taste combining 3 kinda of rum
2014-05-27 14:46:08	mostlybadfly	Dat rum
2014-05-27 14:46:36	mostlybadfly	I haven't had a ton of it to be honest. I think I got too sick off of them in my earlier drinking days
2014-05-27 14:46:48	soehlert_	ah you gotta try cachaca. so delicious
2014-05-27 14:46:50	mostlybadfly	So now the taste is ruined. I'm sure people say this often
2014-05-27 14:47:02	mostlybadfly	Yeah I like that because it isn't as sweet
2014-05-27 14:47:03	soehlert_	but ya i get avoiding captain or whatever now.
2014-05-27 14:47:28	mostlybadfly	I like caipirinhas
2014-05-27 14:47:49	soehlert_	i was just gonna say that. i had one while out in miami one night and thats why i bought the bottle when i got home
2014-05-27 14:53:04	mostlybadfly	Nice.
2014-05-27 16:16:18	soehlert_	mikede__: just got a text complaining of soreness after the 5k

2014-05-27 16:27:49	soehlert_	old one die or did you make some improvements?
2014-05-27 16:28:01	tljohnsn	Old one sort of died....
2014-05-27 16:28:15	tljohnsn	But wort_ fixed it by fsck in his phone.
2014-05-27 16:28:25	soehlert_	hahah of course
2014-05-27 16:29:14	wort_	I forgot how slow that old phone was.
2014-05-27 16:29:31	tljohnsn	I changed our dry erase board procedures into script form also and put in github
2014-05-27 16:29:53	wort_	I forgot we even had procedures :)
2014-05-27 16:30:11	tljohnsn	They were sort of crudely documented :)
2014-05-27 16:30:56	wort_	Did you make a new one or image the old one?
2014-05-27 16:31:14	tljohnsn	new image, the old one was 16gb and I didn't have another card that big
2014-05-27 16:31:46	tljohnsn	The new raspbian has shortcuts to "wolfram" and mathematica on the default desktop
2014-05-27 16:31:57	wort_	yeah
2014-05-27 16:32:16	tljohnsn	mma startup was about 3 minutes.
2014-05-27 16:32:25	tljohnsn	But after that it actually worked pretty well.

2014-05-28 11:57:58	Jerknette	tljohnsn: crap, I have sauerkraut for you
2014-05-28 11:58:01	Jerknette	at home
2014-05-28 11:58:23	Jerknette	Dop was supposed to bring you some when he came to your house to try out the new pinball game but it didn't happen
2014-05-28 11:58:28	tljohnsn	No worries, it will keep
2014-05-28 11:58:53	Jerknette	this time I used Savoy cabbage, I like it more than traditional green
2014-05-28 12:02:11	tljohnsn	Hmmm - never had it.
2014-05-28 12:10:13	Jerknette	it's like the curly parsley of cabbage, that's as best as I can describe it, got a more confetti texture
2014-05-28 12:11:27	Dop2__	oh sure, blame me.
2014-05-28 12:26:59	Jerknette	no
2014-05-28 12:27:00	Jerknette	dop
2014-05-28 12:27:35	Jerknette	Dop2__: I'm not blaming you, I'm just saying I was planning on sending a jar with you, and then you got lazy and didn't go to Trent's house
2014-05-28 12:27:39	Jerknette	no blame
2014-05-28 12:27:42	Jerknette	just FACTS
2014-05-28 12:47:56	mikede__	Are you bringing us some when you come to Seattle Jerknette?
2014-05-28 12:48:11	Jerknette	facts? or sauerkraut?
2014-05-28 13:00:45	mikede__	Sauerkraut
2014-05-28 13:01:28	Jerknette	I don't think I can take it on the plane with me :) I'd have to check it
2014-05-28 13:03:13	mikede__	Geez
2014-05-28 13:03:15	mikede__	I will have to deal
2014-05-28 13:06:22	Jerknette	I will show you how I do it
2014-05-28 13:06:35	Jerknette	but you'll have to wait four weeks for it to sauerrrrr
2014-05-28 13:19:24	mikede__	Yea I know it takes awhile
2014-05-28 13:26:31	Jerknette	mikede__: last year I pickled jalapeno halves from my garden(and soehlert_ & tljohnsn ) -- damn, it was pretty tasty stuff
2014-05-28 13:27:42	Jerknette	used the same fermentation method as the sauerkraut, I just had to add more brine because the peppers don't give off enough water
2014-05-28 13:27:53	Jerknette	spicy as hell!
2014-05-28 13:28:44	mikede__	I bet
2014-05-28 13:28:56	soehlert_	mehhh just right not too spicy
2014-05-28 13:29:42	Jerknette	I bought some pickling weights this past weekend
2014-05-28 13:30:03	Jerknette	for quality control
2014-05-28 13:30:41	Jerknette	I'm using a saucer and a weight currently, it works fairly well but I would prefer a flatter surface to press down

2014-05-30 10:57:25	tljohnsn	next week sometime.   She has to wait 24 hours to reschedule and then they will schedule it 5 days out.
2014-05-30 11:02:11	Jerknette	tljohnsn: does she know what she missed?
2014-05-30 11:02:41	tljohnsn	Sort of - they gave her a graph of her relative scores in each section.
2014-05-30 11:03:04	tljohnsn	The passed the illinois part though, so she only has to retake the national portion.
2014-05-30 11:03:08	Jerknette	ah, that's good, at least she knows what she needs to focus on
2014-05-30 11:15:25	soehlert_	isnt that how it always goes? she was saying how the illinois part was going to be tough

2014-05-30 11:31:23	soehlert_	i have no more shelf room :(
2014-05-30 11:31:41	Dop2__	with a chainsaw you can cut wood for more shelves.
2014-05-30 11:31:49	Dop2__	they've got a lot of trees over in Hessel you could use.
2014-05-30 11:32:13	soehlert_	hessel is soooo far away
2014-05-30 11:32:20	Dop2__	(I've always wondered what would happen if you just started cutting trees down in town.   Like, all those trees north of Beckman along University.)
2014-05-30 11:32:37	Dop2__	put on an orange vest and start cutting trees until they stop you.
2014-05-30 11:32:38	soehlert_	i bet if you had a green truck and juts pretended like you were supposed to, nothing would happen
2014-05-30 11:32:50	Dop2__	then lay one down across the street.

2014-05-30 11:43:02	Dop2__	"What are you doing?"  "The trees are bad."
2014-05-30 11:43:43	Dop2__	It'd be like the beginning of Cool Hand Luke, but with trees instead of parking meters.
2014-05-30 11:43:59	Jerknette	parking meters can easily be replaced

2014-06-02 13:41:09	tljohnsn	wort: what was that editor called?
2014-06-02 13:41:34	soehlert_	atom
2014-06-02 13:41:53	Dop2__	Sublime Text 2
2014-06-02 13:42:03	Dop2__	(at least that's the version I have for Mac)
2014-06-02 13:42:05	soehlert_	bro those people all switched over to atom
2014-06-02 13:42:41	Jerknette	I use Sublime Text 2, not that my n00b opinion matters
2014-06-02 13:43:03	Dop2__	I use it whenever I have a coding project..... so rare.
2014-06-02 13:44:38	tljohnsn	thanks
2014-06-02 13:46:08	soehlert_	damnit someone use atom so i can hear if its actually good or not
2014-06-02 13:52:21	Dop2__	Sublime has a Bro color addition.
2014-06-02 13:52:25	Dop2__	I think Liam made it.
2014-06-02 13:52:40	tljohnsn	I heard it's good, but never used it.
2014-06-02 13:52:47	tljohnsn	They only make binaries for osx...
2014-06-02 13:53:02	tljohnsn	I don't really do much editing on macs...
2014-06-02 14:02:22	soehlert_	oh nevermind on the atom then either
2014-06-02 14:08:53	mikede__	I have heard atom has some issues with large files
2014-06-02 14:09:27	soehlert_	is that inherent to node.js or did they mess up?
2014-06-02 14:13:00	mikede__	I think it is just a new editor and editing large files is tough
2014-06-02 14:13:23	soehlert_	ya thats kinda what i meant, "mess up" is a bit harsher than i was going for
2014-06-02 15:24:24	Dop2__	I really struggle to stay focused when it's a boring task.
2014-06-02 15:25:07	soehlert_	whatcha workin on?
2014-06-02 15:25:22	Dop2__	managery stuff.
2014-06-02 15:25:45	Dop2__	luckily, Pandora just decided to play Leo Kottke.
2014-06-02 15:25:46	soehlert_	paperwork? gross
2014-06-02 15:28:16	Dop2__	I feel like we should take a week off and just sit on the deck and have some beers.
2014-06-02 15:28:37	soehlert_	boy does that sound appealing
2014-06-02 15:30:37	Dop2__	occasionally throw a frisbee or football around, then sit back down.
2014-06-02 15:31:00	soehlert_	that sounds like the Dop-est vacaation ever
2014-06-02 15:44:44	buraglio	I've heard great things about ST2
2014-06-02 15:44:48	buraglio	I use BBEdit still
2014-06-02 15:44:51	buraglio	or vim
2014-06-02 15:45:24	soehlert_	is it true ST2 development dried up?
2014-06-02 15:45:34	buraglio	Dop2__: first order of business is to on-board tljohnsn.
2014-06-02 15:45:42	buraglio	second order of business, shit can tljohnsn
2014-06-02 15:46:05	buraglio	thrd order of business, shit ON tljohnsn
2014-06-02 15:46:32	buraglio	fourth order of business, repeat
2014-06-02 15:46:43	buraglio	soehlert_: not sure
2014-06-02 15:46:55	buraglio	I hope not I kinda want to try it out
2014-06-02 15:47:09	buraglio	but I already own BBedit, so I never really got around to it
2014-06-02 15:50:41	Dop2__	tljohnsn's already causing me problems.
2014-06-02 15:51:32	tljohnsn	I thought my job was to cause you problems.
2014-06-02 16:05:35	soehlert_	any dhcp server smart people here?
2014-06-02 16:06:58	tljohnsn	maybe
2014-06-02 16:07:13	tljohnsn	What is up?
2014-06-02 16:07:38	Dop2__	buraglio could help if it was running a BSD box from '89.
2014-06-02 16:07:41	soehlert_	trying to set up dhcpd as part of a new kickstart server. in my conf i have the range specified as .90-.100 yet it keeps getting .78
2014-06-02 16:07:44	soehlert_	Dop2__: nice
2014-06-02 16:07:59	soehlert_	tcpdump verifies that it's talking to the right kickstart server
2014-06-02 16:08:13	Dop2__	does it do ranges like that or by subnet mask?
2014-06-02 16:08:25	soehlert_	by ranges
2014-06-02 16:08:25	soehlert_	at least it did on the old kickstart server
2014-06-02 16:09:03	tljohnsn	Is there possibly a static entry for that mac address already somewhere else in your conf?
2014-06-02 16:09:05	soehlert_	http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/dhcpd.conf.5.html
2014-06-02 16:09:05	soehlert_	it does
2014-06-02 16:09:19	soehlert_	there's not. its about a 25 line conf

2014-06-02 16:26:59	soehlert_	i got it figured out
2014-06-02 16:27:14	soehlert_	rhel moved the dhcpd.conf file from /etc/ to /etc/dhcpd/ in rhel6
2014-06-02 16:28:12	tljohnsn	Yep, that move still drives me nuts
2014-06-02 16:28:42	soehlert_	turns out i was mashing up the public and private ip address so my next server wasn't getting set right either...sigh

2014-06-03 07:49:05	mostlybadfly	At least this will help me understand what is going on if I ever have to use devise later
2014-06-03 07:50:08	mostlybadfly	Also guys, check pit Caret. It is a free sublime clone that is a chrome extension
2014-06-03 07:50:18	mostlybadfly	Kinda interesting. I use it on my chromebook
2014-06-03 07:53:17	mostlybadfly	I feel like if I get far into this I might actually get macbook of some sort
2014-06-03 08:46:09	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: do it... join us
2014-06-03 08:46:36	mostlybadfly	Haha I was about to say only motivation is to troll the fanboys
2014-06-03 08:46:56	mostlybadfly	But I can see it seems to be a tool of the trade
2014-06-03 08:47:13	mostlybadfly	Motivation to not use one I mean
2014-06-03 08:47:54	mostlybadfly	I took a rails tutorial and this guy was like on for got you need this application and I'm like why can't you just do it in terminal?
2014-06-03 08:48:31	mostlybadfly	Ugh can't type on phone
2014-06-03 08:48:38	mostlybadfly	For git*
2014-06-03 08:49:01	mostlybadfly	And he had all this special automated Mac stuff . it wasn't faster but it is easier
2014-06-03 08:49:39	mostlybadfly	Like using vim vs sublime or something. I get it's faster but it def is swingdick scenario to say you only use vim
2014-06-03 08:51:06	Jerknette	I think vi is fine for small changes, but if you're editing a whole page I have to say a text editor is needed, at least for me, my vi-foo isn't has strong as those who have been using it for decades

2014-06-03 10:27:45	soehlert_	tljohnsn: before you left or on the way in?
2014-06-03 10:28:34	tljohnsn	Before I left - had drive to durst to get a new tube cause I was out of spares too.
2014-06-03 10:28:48	soehlert_	oof
2014-06-03 10:41:26	mostlybadfly	I'm not disagreeing but I don't find my Linux desktop to be a pain
2014-06-03 10:41:47	soehlert_	what about linux laptop?
2014-06-03 10:41:52	mostlybadfly	If you mean there are programs and guis to make the job somewhat easier then yeah
2014-06-03 10:42:25	mostlybadfly	I have the chromebook setup to run a Linux shell and otherwise I have my editor and other tools
2014-06-03 10:42:41	mostlybadfly	Not saying it is as powerful but I've had an easy time doing things
2014-06-03 10:42:59	soehlert_	right but have you ever tried to take a generic laptop and get linux running on it? there's a pretty decent chance it's gonna take some work. 
2014-06-03 10:43:12	mostlybadfly	Yes I have. It was easy for me
2014-06-03 10:43:15	soehlert_	just playing devil's advocate though, i could do just fine if i had to with a linux laptop
2014-06-03 10:43:26	mostlybadfly	But the dell I had seemed to almost be built for it
2014-06-03 10:43:29	soehlert_	then you got lucky. no x issues, no wifi driver issues, no video card issues
2014-06-03 10:43:46	mostlybadfly	Well the only issue was the nvidia driver which can just be updated
2014-06-03 10:43:49	tljohnsn	We did set one up with ubuntu the other day - sound, webcam, wifi, all worked out of the box
2014-06-03 10:43:54	mostlybadfly	I guess I was lucky
2014-06-03 10:44:00	tljohnsn	Even multihead support worked
2014-06-03 10:44:08	soehlert_	wow impressive
2014-06-03 10:44:23	mostlybadfly	I don't know it's like the mentality of iPhone culture. If its not all just there for me then it's a problem
2014-06-03 10:44:33	tljohnsn	Only problem was strongswan vpn had a known crappy version, so we got a different version out of testing.
2014-06-03 10:44:49	soehlert_	mbf: huh?
2014-06-03 10:45:24	mostlybadfly	I mean in the sense that it's just a different animal
2014-06-03 10:45:38	soehlert_	i just didnt understand at all what you were saying haha
2014-06-03 10:45:42	mostlybadfly	It isn't problematic to configure Linux because I want it
2014-06-03 10:46:36	mostlybadfly	I don't know what I'm saying. I want a macbook at some point that is all lol
2014-06-03 10:46:47	soehlert_	haha fair enough. 
2014-06-03 10:47:27	tljohnsn	mbf yeah - for laptops osx is a lot nicer to use than linux.
2014-06-03 10:47:36	mostlybadfly	I'll probably try to find the right Linux laptop first but I know the standard is Mac for some obv reasons
2014-06-03 10:48:00	tljohnsn	in my opinion.
2014-06-03 10:48:26	mostlybadfly	I def like my desktop more than the dell laptop with linux
2014-06-03 10:48:38	mostlybadfly	But now my only laptop is chromebook at the moment
2014-06-03 11:24:44	WeeJay	tljohnsn: yup...i have given up on linux on desktop...OSX is far better choice
2014-06-03 11:25:41	WeeJay	chromebook looks like an attractive offer but not sure how practical it would be for a daily driver
2014-06-03 11:25:57	soehlert_	well lookey here..

2014-06-04 11:44:05	tljohnsn	You are right, it is 8 but still too many for me since they are so tiny.

2014-06-05 08:06:35	Jerknette	good morning mostlybadfly
2014-06-05 08:06:52	mostlybadfly	Haaaaaaay Jerknette what's good ma
2014-06-05 08:06:54	mostlybadfly	Lol
2014-06-05 08:07:10	Jerknette	not much, it's just us two early birds
2014-06-05 08:07:20	mostlybadfly	I know right!
2014-06-05 08:07:28	mostlybadfly	I love this time of day hehe
2014-06-05 08:08:08	mostlybadfly	Jerknette: new Andrew bird album is so good if you're into him
2014-06-05 08:08:13	Jerknette	yeah, my office is DEAD, I'm the only one here on this side of the second floor
2014-06-05 08:08:14	mostlybadfly	Good morning music
2014-06-05 08:08:24	Jerknette	I don't think I know him
2014-06-05 08:08:39	mostlybadfly	Oh you should check him out he is great
2014-06-05 08:08:55	Jerknette	I will do that now
2014-06-05 08:09:00	mostlybadfly	Check out his album The Mysterious Production of Eggs
2014-06-05 08:09:20	Jerknette	it's not that mysterious, scientists have pretty much figured that one out
2014-06-05 08:09:23	Jerknette	;)
2014-06-05 08:09:49	mostlybadfly	Haha
2014-06-05 08:10:10	mostlybadfly	That is the album drew and I listened to all the time when we first started dating
2014-06-05 08:10:17	mostlybadfly	It holds a special place in my heart
2014-06-05 08:10:21	Jerknette	oh yeah, this picture alone is my speed: http://www.hitherandthither.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bird-andrew-4f888d1a2e611.jpg
2014-06-05 08:10:43	mostlybadfly	But all his stuff is great. Good folk/rock/americana
2014-06-05 08:10:58	mostlybadfly	Oh yeah and he is dreamy too
2014-06-05 08:11:56	mostlybadfly	I think he's so sort of music savant. His timing and musicality live is ridic but he is somewhat awkward otherwise
2014-06-05 08:13:14	Jerknette	yeah, he's very quiet
2014-06-05 08:13:33	Jerknette	I would imagine that sound would be hard to capture live in a theater instead of a small studio
2014-06-05 08:18:04	mostlybadfly	He does an annual Xmas concert at 4th Presbyterian church that captures the sound well
2014-06-05 08:18:14	mostlybadfly	Due to the space. It is a beautiful performance
2014-06-05 09:16:40	mostlybadfly	My boss got a ramen cup from the vending machine and is having that this morning for breakfast

2014-06-05 09:56:05	mostlybadfly	Yum
2014-06-05 09:56:49	Jerknette	it's my version of tzatziki sauce
2014-06-05 09:57:13	Jerknette	with more cucumbers, so I'm not just eating a bowl of plain yogurt with cucumber bits

2014-06-05 11:09:53	WeeJay	Jerknette: audio recording has too much echo
2014-06-05 11:12:53	WeeJay	good video otherwise
2014-06-05 11:42:20	Dop2__	yeah, I mentioned that to her, but I think they just don't have high quality equipment.
2014-06-05 11:48:26	WeeJay	Corny joke alert!  What do you call a cluster of Bro's?
2014-06-05 11:52:12	soehlert_	what?
2014-06-05 11:52:54	WeeJay	Bromance
2014-06-05 12:08:22	mikede__	It never fails. Start looking at someone else's code and you slowly start to think they are not as good of a coder.... It might take a day, a week, a month or a year....
2014-06-05 12:14:45	Dop2__	odd, I usually start thinking I'm not as good of a coder.  :)
2014-06-05 12:16:25	mikede__	That is a constant
2014-06-05 12:16:37	mikede__	I always assume people are about 10x better than me and then it slowly drops
2014-06-05 13:19:26	Dop2__	nobody has come over to work under the shade tree with me.  :(
2014-06-05 13:20:05	soehlert_	you never mentioned shade tree!
2014-06-05 13:21:22	Dop2__	*sips Dr. Pepper*
2014-06-05 13:34:58	mikede__	You never even offered it to me :(
2014-06-05 14:05:12	Dop2__	technically I never offered it to Sam either.
2014-06-05 14:06:16	soehlert_	please. im on the list right? i can just come and go as i please
2014-06-05 14:16:31	soehlert_	anyone know how to see what running services are using a package? aka ldd every_running_service | grep package
2014-06-05 14:19:40	tljohnsn	I think there is not an easy way, hence the reboot culture.
2014-06-05 14:19:57	soehlert_	lsof -n | grep openssl gets the job done. 
2014-06-05 14:20:13	tljohnsn	ahh, good call.
2014-06-05 14:20:27	mikede__	http://voodoodoughnut.com/doughnuts.php This is one thing I am looking forward to next week, that and seeing Dop drunk
2014-06-05 14:20:31	soehlert_	i work with smart people
2014-06-05 14:20:36	soehlert_	i didnt come up with it
2014-06-05 14:22:17	tljohnsn	You should get the tex-ass one as homage to your old diggs.
2014-06-05 14:22:31	mikede__	Planning on it
2014-06-05 14:22:41	tljohnsn	haha - just scrolled to that cock-nballs one
2014-06-05 14:23:14	mikede__	:)
2014-06-05 14:23:54	mikede__	I should get that one for the meeting
2014-06-05 14:23:58	mikede__	See who grabs it
2014-06-05 14:24:01	mikede__	But I might be fired
2014-06-05 14:24:02	tljohnsn	haha
2014-06-05 14:24:30	soehlert_	me and Jerknette had a pretty great sexual harrassment discussion yesterday whilst drinking
2014-06-05 14:25:13	mikede__	Oh yea?
2014-06-05 14:25:30	mikede__	I know the tech industry is coming under fire again for being very anti-girl
2014-06-05 14:25:36	mikede__	err anti-non-male
2014-06-05 14:25:41	soehlert_	mostly sexually harrassing each other and planning out our impending lawsuits
2014-06-05 14:25:48	mikede__	oh nice
2014-06-05 14:26:10	soehlert_	we decided we'd both hire Merk to lawyer against himself
2014-06-05 14:27:21	Jerknette	mikede__: yeah, except I think soehlert_ has a stronger case because Merk thinks harassment is unavoidable
2014-06-05 14:27:30	Jerknette	at least where women are concerned
2014-06-05 14:28:33	mikede__	How so?
2014-06-05 14:28:38	Jerknette	I'm just going to have to work extra hard at harassing him, because even if I'm at fault, I can still ruin his self-esteem and confidence
2014-06-05 14:29:32	Jerknette	he said something to the effect of "guys do this, it's not personal" but this was a long time ago and I didn't have enough time to engage him in the conversation, it was at a loud restaurant
2014-06-05 14:29:43	Jerknette	oh wait
2014-06-05 14:29:44	Jerknette	I remember
2014-06-05 14:29:49	Jerknette	"guys are always going to hit on girls
2014-06-05 14:29:51	Jerknette	"
2014-06-05 14:30:33	mikede__	Yea, kind of in our nature
2014-06-05 14:30:53	mikede__	That is why I think it is always silly for guys to be really good friends with girls
2014-06-05 14:31:04	mikede__	It is going to end up poorly one way or another
2014-06-05 14:31:12	mikede__	*unless the guy is gay
2014-06-05 14:31:21	mikede__	*not into girls
2014-06-05 14:32:58	Jerknette	I'm going to call bullshit on this, but this is an enormous topic, so don't take it to mean I'm dismissing you entirely :)
2014-06-05 14:33:22	Jerknette	girls like guys too
2014-06-05 14:33:26	Jerknette	they don't hit on them at work
2014-06-05 14:33:31	soehlert_	not in my experience
2014-06-05 14:33:41	mostlybadfly	Yeah I'm sorry but that is nonsense
2014-06-05 14:33:46	Jerknette	ha!  is that directed at me, soehlert_ ?
2014-06-05 14:33:58	soehlert_	yuuup
2014-06-05 14:34:09	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: Me? or mikede__ ?
2014-06-05 14:34:22	mostlybadfly	The fact that guys can't be friends.
2014-06-05 14:34:40	mostlybadfly	I guess it happens in practice but it doesn't really make it OK or the norm
2014-06-05 14:35:18	mostlybadfly	I think it says more about men that that is even a concern. Just don't be a dick
2014-06-05 14:35:50	mostlybadfly	I have gay friends but I'm not hitting on them
2014-06-05 14:35:54	mikede__	Yea
2014-06-05 14:36:02	mikede__	My comment was just in general
2014-06-05 14:36:09	mikede__	I have about 8,000 caveats to it
2014-06-05 14:36:13	Jerknette	In my defense I only hit on soehlert_ when I'm drunk at work
2014-06-05 14:36:20	mostlybadfly	Yeah I mean I know you don't think it should happen or anything
2014-06-05 14:36:21	Jerknette	outside of work I hit on him all the time but that doesn't count
2014-06-05 14:36:36	soehlert_	everyone does
2014-06-05 14:36:47	mostlybadfly	That's why I didn't call him when he came into town
2014-06-05 14:36:56	mostlybadfly	I wouldn't be able to resist hitting on him
2014-06-05 14:36:56	soehlert_	makes sense
2014-06-05 14:37:02	Jerknette	ha
2014-06-05 14:37:06	soehlert_	hell i even hit on myself from time to time
2014-06-05 14:37:20	mikede__	But most guys their main evolved purpose is to spread their genes to as many females as possible. So....
2014-06-05 14:37:35	Jerknette	mikede__: doesn't that annoy you that your gender is perceived as not in control of their emotions/attractions
2014-06-05 14:37:51	soehlert_	nah its cool its like the rob ford i was drunk defense
2014-06-05 14:38:02	mostlybadfly	s/emotions/dongs/
2014-06-05 14:38:23	mikede__	I think it is correct for the most part. Most people have little self-control. You had in hormones and it isn't going to end well.
2014-06-05 14:38:48	mikede__	err You add in..
2014-06-05 14:39:10	mostlybadfly	There was this quote that was like homophobia is the fear that a man is going to treat you the way men treat women
2014-06-05 14:39:12	Jerknette	There are lots of dudes I would hit on, but 1) I'm married, 2) if I'm at work it's not appropriate
2014-06-05 14:39:21	soehlert_	slut
2014-06-05 14:39:31	mostlybadfly	Omg slut shaming
2014-06-05 14:39:36	Jerknette	I know right

2014-06-05 14:40:12	Jerknette	you just slut shamed me, IN TEXT
2014-06-05 14:40:25	soehlert_	there was no shame. it was factual yo
2014-06-05 14:40:36	Dop2__	she's going to win cause she's female.. it's like the inverse.
2014-06-05 14:40:40	Jerknette	wow, Ron Sterling, welcome to the party
2014-06-05 14:40:43	soehlert_	nothing wrong with being slutty. i love being slutty
2014-06-05 14:40:57	soehlert_	itd be better if females played along though :(
2014-06-05 14:41:24	Dop2__	you should all listen to Patrice O'Neal's (sp?) comedy bit on National Sexual Harrassment Day
2014-06-05 14:41:59	mostlybadfly	There is prestige in men being sluts not women

2014-06-05 14:42:10	mostlybadfly	That's kinda the issue and why she would win
2014-06-05 14:42:25	soehlert_	i hope nobody is taking me seriuosly. ever
2014-06-05 14:42:42	Jerknette	I am
2014-06-05 14:42:50	soehlert_	meh you dont count. cuz you're a 
2014-06-05 14:42:54	soehlert_	jerk
2014-06-05 14:43:21	mikede__	Well our culture is pretty misogynistic but that is changing I think
2014-06-05 14:43:21	mostlybadfly	Lolol
2014-06-05 14:43:39	mostlybadfly	Thank goodness
2014-06-05 14:43:42	Jerknette	I sure do hope so, I need to make more money
2014-06-05 14:43:49	soehlert_	work harder/better
2014-06-05 14:43:56	soehlert_	you have the perfect example in your own home...
2014-06-05 14:44:01	Jerknette	lilly ledbetter

2014-06-05 14:44:33	mostlybadfly	I'm just keeding
2014-06-05 14:44:34	soehlert_	i thought being a dime was a good thing
2014-06-05 14:44:45	soehlert_	you kids and your lingo
2014-06-05 14:45:29	mikede__	Most younger women make more than young men now a days

2014-06-05 14:45:53	Jerknette	I know, the funny thing about gender discrimination, is that I get to be punished for my decision to not have kids because I won't get paid as much as a man AND I won't even be able to take maternity leave
2014-06-05 14:46:52	mikede__	I don't see it as a punishment for not getting maternity / paternity leave. Having a kid sucks. If you wanted someone to come back after two weeks (or whatever) they would be more of a drain then a help.

2014-06-05 14:47:32	soehlert_	well that doesnt make sense since im already a drain on the office
2014-06-05 14:47:33	mikede__	Especially women as they just had a major trauma to their bodies
2014-06-05 14:48:01	Jerknette	what I"m saying is that as a women, statistically I'm paid less, managers might not hire me for a job based on their perception of my age and expectation that I would leave a job for maternity reasons...
2014-06-05 14:48:05	Jerknette	but I'm not going to
2014-06-05 14:48:30	Jerknette	I don't begrudge maternity/paternity leave
2014-06-05 14:48:42	mikede__	That is happening more and more for guys as well. Dop doesn't give me work because I have kid.
2014-06-05 14:48:47	mostlybadfly	I do
2014-06-05 14:49:26	Jerknette	I have to look this up, but I heard about some study confirming that men get paid more than women, but also fathers get paid more than men who don't have kids
2014-06-05 14:49:41	mikede__	Maybe back in the day
2014-06-05 14:49:49	Jerknette	so women are punished for having kids, men are rewarded... let me see if I can find it
2014-06-05 14:49:51	mikede__	Also depends on the type of company
2014-06-05 14:50:21	mikede__	Then you have SV who discriminates against age for the most part, blah blah and having a kid  is looked down upon
2014-06-05 14:50:25	mostlybadfly	There is a bias for people with kids in little ways
2014-06-05 14:50:25	mostlybadfly	I've noticed preference for vacation days to going home earlier
2014-06-05 14:50:43	mostlybadfly	To first choice of schedule
2014-06-05 14:50:44	mikede__	Interesting
2014-06-05 14:51:02	Jerknette	yeah, that's covered in a book called The Baby Boon
2014-06-05 14:51:17	mikede__	Then again I don't agree with the whole hours things any ways, but I am odd
2014-06-05 14:51:28	mostlybadfly	I don't breed so I don't know why I should care about anyone else's spawn
2014-06-05 14:51:36	Jerknette	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2648719/The-daddy-bonus-unavailable-hardworking-moms-How-men-receive-25-PAY-RISE-fathers.html
2014-06-05 14:51:55	mikede__	You shouldn't, except for how it could effect the other person's output.
2014-06-05 14:52:35	mostlybadfly	Once their maternity leave is done they should do their work
2014-06-05 14:52:35	mostlybadfly	That's about it
2014-06-05 14:52:50	mikede__	Yep
2014-06-05 14:52:53	mostlybadfly	I mean in a perfect world
2014-06-05 14:53:20	mostlybadfly	I'm not anti kid mind you
2014-06-05 14:53:33	mostlybadfly	I just hate the mentality that people care or should care about your kids
2014-06-05 14:54:20	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: agreed, it's not like parents give a shit about other people's kids, just their own
2014-06-05 14:54:24	Jerknette	as they should
2014-06-05 14:54:34	Jerknette	but that doesn't mean that I should :)
2014-06-05 14:55:16	mostlybadfly	I've had people try to cut in line at the store because of it even
2014-06-05 14:55:20	mostlybadfly	And I'm like don't have them then
2014-06-05 14:55:21	mostlybadfly	Not my problem
2014-06-05 14:55:59	mikede__	eh, having a kids is like getting a lot of money. It is going to amplify who you are
2014-06-05 14:56:00	Jerknette	you should park in the expectant mother lots too :)
2014-06-05 14:56:05	Jerknette	I haven't yet, but someday I will

2014-06-05 14:56:43	mostlybadfly	But it is valued I get that
2014-06-05 15:01:11	tljohnsn	So how much of the supposed 25% pay raise is from new fathers being like "oh shit I got a kid now, I better look for a better paying job" - just sayin'...
2014-06-05 15:04:46	mikede__	Yep
2014-06-05 15:04:58	mikede__	Or "oh shit I have to work a ton harder as I have a kid to take care of"
2014-06-05 15:05:09	tljohnsn	Yeah, exactly.
2014-06-05 15:05:32	mikede__	Many people suck at negotiating salaries as well and if you all of a sudden start to care that can make a difference as well

2014-06-06 08:47:24	Dop2__	I shouldn't be allowed to be audited by people that don't understand the work I'm doing.
2014-06-06 08:48:52	Jerknette	Dop2__: this is a third party?
2014-06-06 08:49:08	Jerknette	can you complain that they hired the wrong consultant agency?
2014-06-06 09:03:23	Dop2__	I don't think we even get to choose.

2014-06-06 10:42:22	mikede__	I have noticed Dop just likes to complain
2014-06-06 10:42:28	mikede__	Maybe that is his coping mechanism :P
2014-06-06 10:42:43	mikede__	The audit people ask for some silly things though
2014-06-06 10:42:46	soehlert_	im just amazed he's still complaining about the same thing. must really suck
2014-06-06 10:44:34	mikede__	Lots of requests
2014-06-06 10:45:00	mikede__	I hate how people latch on to a new term and use the shit out of it. Currently it is "red team" for any assessment that our group can do.
2014-06-06 10:45:25	Jerknette	mikede__: I was just asking Dop what that meant yesterday because I've been hearing it thrown around here too
2014-06-06 10:45:50	mikede__	Red team - aka do security testing like an attacker...oooohhhh scary
2014-06-06 10:46:16	mikede__	I think people just assume security testing is some automated tool that we throw at stuff

2014-06-06 13:02:43	Jerknette	FYI, I have the New Order song, it might be an unofficial anthem, but that doesn't make it a good song.  The video is pretty cute, though
2014-06-06 13:16:38	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: I have a disco ball of tunes in my head right now: Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor

2014-06-10 10:33:20	Jerknette	I dreamt that she was driving in this giant SUV with me and Dop and I think some other people, and we were talking like we're old friends, and she didn't say anything about JayZ but eventually she was like, "I'm so mad at my sister, she has such a hot temper", and then we drove through a tornado, it was a small tornado, and the giant SUV didn't even flip

2014-06-10 10:50:38	Jerknette	I listen to Fresh Air, as most people know because I probably talk about Terry Gross more than Dop2__ , and I also listen to Sound Opinions, Snap Judgement, This American Life, On the Media, and other odds and ends

2014-06-10 11:37:14	Jerknette	WeeJay: thank you for saying that about Radio Lab
2014-06-10 11:37:18	Jerknette	that drives me bonkers
2014-06-10 11:37:43	Jerknette	I don't know why they do that, it's so distracting
2014-06-10 11:37:52	Jerknette	especially in the beginning
2014-06-10 11:38:17	Jerknette	I mean, in the intro of the episode... blech!  Just spit it out already
2014-06-10 11:39:03	Jerknette	I think Snap Judgement and Resound(if you've heard of that one) has a more balanced editing team
2014-06-10 11:39:18	soehlert_	look at the podcast hipster here..."if you've heard of that one"
2014-06-10 11:39:47	WeeJay	Jerknette: yup Resound is  also a good one
2014-06-10 11:39:59	WeeJay	sounds like you and i are NPR whores
2014-06-10 11:40:04	Jerknette	aw jeeze, soehlert_ you are so sensitive
2014-06-10 11:40:54	Jerknette	yup, I'm a sustainer of my local station, but I listen to WBEZ's live stream a lot on Saturday afternoons when I'm cleaning and running errands
2014-06-10 11:43:30	WeeJay	i wanted to attend the wait wait show once more before carl castle retired but didn't get around to it.  Bill Curtis seems to be fitting into that role quiet well.
2014-06-10 11:43:58	WeeJay	if you never attended the live taping, i recommend it. it is a very fun experience
2014-06-10 11:44:42	soehlert_	oh god john oliver on the death penalty. comparing it to the mcrib..
2014-06-10 11:45:10	WeeJay	it is so good to see all these guys from daily show branching out into their own thing.
2014-06-10 11:45:33	WeeJay	I am sad to hear colbert report end :-(
2014-06-10 11:46:15	Jerknette	WeeJay: it's time
2014-06-10 11:46:20	Jerknette	he's accomplished a lot on that show
2014-06-10 11:46:55	soehlert_	im interested to see what he's like on the late show or whatever its called
2014-06-10 11:46:59	Jerknette	WeeJay: I think he's ready for his real persona to come out, playing a character like that is hard
2014-06-10 11:47:23	WeeJay	Jerknette: yeah..did you ever watch his interview iwth eric smidth from googole
2014-06-10 11:47:45	WeeJay	it was an interesting peek into his real persona. he has given a few such interviews since then
2014-06-10 11:52:34	Jerknette	WeeJay: no, I've listened to his interviews on Fresh Air of course, and he reminds me of Marty Duffy in some ways, like Jimmy Fallon reminds me of Marty... likeable, unassuming, family-oriented Catholic, but not too Catholic
2014-06-10 11:53:17	WeeJay	i met Marty once and that is a pretty good description of him...didn't talk to him long enough to get the Catholic feel but rest is dead on
2014-06-10 11:53:22	WeeJay	great guy
2014-06-10 11:56:42	WeeJay	i love how youtube had dumped flash and converted all videos to html5
2014-06-10 12:09:18	Jerknette	WeeJay: Yeah, he and Katherine are the kind of liberal Catholics that helped changed the world for the better in the 60s and 70s, focus on social change, eliminating poverty and injustice, less preachy, I'm sure they probably love the new pope
2014-06-10 12:09:46	Jerknette	I was raised Catholic so culturally I still feel connected to the church
2014-06-10 12:09:57	Jerknette	not so much literally/spiritually :)
2014-06-10 12:13:18	WeeJay	Jerknette: i know exactly what you mean and when i run into folks like those (lead by practice and not preachy) I feel even more conflicted about religion.  They make me want to believe something good can indeed come from religion...but then i run into my sister and reminded why i can't stand religion :D
2014-06-10 12:14:39	WeeJay	over the weekend i attended my niece's graduation and one of the students who spoke was a great example of brainwashed output ...  part of his opening remark was a dig at public school "where they worship the creation and not the creator"
2014-06-10 12:19:58	Jerknette	aw jeeze, that's what kills me about the indoctrination of young people... they lack life context to put these big questions in their proper place
2014-06-10 12:22:34	WeeJay	can anyone suggest some simple lawn games like Flimsee and Ladder Toss?  Trying to gather some ideas for a family (adults) even I am organizing.
2014-06-10 12:23:51	Jerknette	lawn darts
2014-06-10 12:24:48	WeeJay	yeah saw that..i was trying to find games where i can build stuff and does not take up too much space
2014-06-10 12:25:12	WeeJay	lawn darts ill have to buy...if i can't come up with ideas, i might do that
2014-06-10 12:26:22	Jerknette	WeeJay: don't buy lawn darts, they are extremely dangerous
2014-06-10 12:26:26	Jerknette	sorry, I was joking
2014-06-10 12:27:02	WeeJay	i saw a video of "safe version" of lawn darts.  They are rounded ..not sharp.
2014-06-10 12:28:17	Jerknette	if you have the space bocce ball, or frisbee, or badmitton
2014-06-10 12:28:25	Jerknette	badminton.. sp?
2014-06-10 12:31:31	WeeJay	we are planning the picnic in the forest preserve and dunno how the wind might be but it is on my list since I already own everything for it.
2014-06-10 12:32:18	WeeJay	this is a cousins yearly picnic and i was trying to gather games which can be safely handed to the next organizer
2014-06-10 12:32:30	WeeJay	flimsee already uses frisbee and i love that game.
2014-06-10 12:56:39	Jerknette	WeeJay: water balloons are always good, too
2014-06-10 13:25:10	WeeJay	Jerknette: you watch the lip sync battle on fallon? Paul Rudd's is still the best episode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LvMeYEwWGQ
2014-06-10 13:25:38	Jerknette	WeeJay: yeah, I love lyrics, so lip syncing is right up my alley
2014-06-10 13:25:51	WeeJay	have you watched it?
2014-06-10 13:26:30	Jerknette	yeah, and the Emma Stone one
2014-06-10 13:26:49	WeeJay	Emma was good as well
2014-06-10 13:27:28	soehlert_	joseph gordon levitt one was the best
2014-06-10 13:33:51	WeeJay	watching emma again..i forgot about the second song..that was good
2014-06-10 13:42:08	mostlybadfly	Jerknette: TIL that target has a section for men's umbrellas and women's umbrellas
2014-06-10 13:42:34	mostlybadfly	And an associate informed me I might prefer to get one from the men's dept
2014-06-10 13:42:59	Jerknette	whoa
2014-06-10 13:43:26	mostlybadfly	She said we have manly ones if you don't want a girly one
2014-06-10 13:43:29	mostlybadfly	I was like wat
2014-06-10 13:43:46	mostlybadfly	No booboo I want this green one right here. It goes with my shoes
2014-06-10 13:44:18	Jerknette	ha, that's probably something I'd say, just because I'm prone to sticking my foot in my mouth, I hope she caught on and it won't happen to her next time
2014-06-10 13:45:12	mostlybadfly	All the "men's" ones were black
2014-06-10 13:45:21	Jerknette	just like your hearts
2014-06-10 13:45:34	mostlybadfly	As if someone couldn't go to a general umbrella section and just pick what they want
2014-06-10 13:49:56	Jerknette	yeah, an umbrella is a pretty neutral product, weird that we needed gender segregation for it
2014-06-10 13:50:17	Jerknette	it's not like I have to worry about picking the right fit or cup size for an umbrella
2014-06-10 13:51:04	WeeJay	yeah i get annoyed with classifying a color as boy or girl. ran into that with kids clothing....how dumb
2014-06-10 13:51:28	mostlybadfly	It was so odd
2014-06-10 13:51:34	WeeJay	my daughter wears blue all the time..i don't give a shit if someone accidently mistakes her for a boy...it is not world ending
2014-06-10 13:51:38	mostlybadfly	WeeJay: here people make a big deal if a guy wears pink
2014-06-10 13:52:12	soehlert_	what neighborhood are you guys in?
2014-06-10 13:52:15	mostlybadfly	Guys love to talk about how they're wearing pink today
2014-06-10 13:52:41	mostlybadfly	soehlert_: this is a old school corp environment

2014-06-10 13:53:12	soehlert_	boys town?
2014-06-10 13:53:22	Jerknette	I purposely bought my friend Jessica color neutral baby clothes for her daughter, it's all a sea of pink and purple, so annoying

2014-06-10 13:53:31	mostlybadfly	Which some call Mandersonville

2014-06-13 10:59:53	Dop2__	it's almost chilly out today.
2014-06-13 11:03:34	soehlert_	WeeJay: what do you run MoinMoin on?
2014-06-13 11:04:02	soehlert_	Dop2__: it's nice and warm here in front of my big tv with soccer on..
2014-06-13 11:07:05	Dop2__	I'm hopefully going to rock a little yardwork today.
2014-06-13 11:13:27	Jerknette	Dop2__: hook up that electric fense
2014-06-13 11:21:15	Dop2__	that's the plan.
2014-06-13 11:36:40	tljohnsn	Dop2__: It's worse than chilly - it's cold
2014-06-13 11:38:07	tljohnsn	soehlert_: did you get that projector hooked up in your office?
2014-06-13 11:56:47	soehlert_	tljohnsn: i did. unfortunately the computer seems to be a bit limiting on the stream. dunno why. it's like a two year old core i7 with 8GB ram. Stupid flash player probably.
2014-06-13 11:56:47	soehlert_	I know it's not the internet as I was getting ~90Mbps down yesterday

2014-06-13 12:42:55	soehlert_	ah ok. it seems to have been broken by centos6 and they don't seem to have cared about updating it
2014-06-13 12:57:30	tljohnsn	Walker has been gone all week, so we are getting a lot more settlers games in.
2014-06-13 12:57:45	tljohnsn	Just finished 2 games in less than an hour.
2014-06-13 12:57:49	mikede__	nice
2014-06-13 13:03:22	soehlert_	hahah sweet
2014-06-13 13:08:33	tljohnsn	soehlert_: Beers @ my deck after work.
2014-06-13 13:09:17	soehlert_	im headed outta town this evening. thanks though
2014-06-13 13:18:34	tljohnsn	Where to?
2014-06-13 13:29:21	soehlert_	got a wedding (of course) tomorrow up in the burbs. headed to my folks' today. wedding tomorrow. dads day lunch sunday.
2014-06-13 13:29:42	soehlert_	wedding should be pretty crazy. the bride used to babysit for tom ricketts (owner of the Cubs)
2014-06-13 14:19:52	WeeJay	soehlert_: you trying to install moin using some rpm? I won't bother with that and just download the tarball or git pull it.  The way moin works, you can have multiple wiki's from the same code base
2014-06-13 14:20:11	WeeJay	you just specify different data directory and start the daemon on a diff port.
2014-06-13 14:20:43	soehlert_	no they dont exist. i was attempting to build from tarball. moin itself was looking for python modules that don't exist anywhere i can find in centos6
2014-06-13 14:21:01	WeeJay	soehlert_: pip install <module>
2014-06-13 14:21:13	soehlert_	ya tried that. doesn't exist
2014-06-13 14:21:13	soehlert_	looked in epel as well

2014-06-18 10:18:35	Dop2__	Draws are possible in at least the first round of the World Cup.  they don't go to overtime and sudden death until the finals.
2014-06-18 10:19:07	Dop2__	In each group of 4 teams they do a round robin.  You get 3 points for a 'win' and 1 point for a draw.

2014-06-18 10:54:06	Jerknette	Dop2__: soehlert_ maybe they allow draws early on so the teams don't kill themselves early in the tournament
2014-06-18 10:54:27	soehlert_	no its just how soccer does it. they don't normally ever do "sudden death" or overtime
2014-06-18 10:54:35	soehlert_	they use a points system like hockey in every league. 
2014-06-18 10:54:53	soehlert_	(3 pts for a win 1 for a draw 0 for a loss) and they use points to do standings, not wins/losses
2014-06-18 10:55:10	soehlert_	obviously that doesn't work in a knockout tourney, so that's why they do the OT/PKs thing
2014-06-18 11:01:19	buraglio	Dop2__: soehlert_: any recommendations of reasonably good security cons to go to in the next year?
2014-06-18 11:01:42	soehlert_	im not really plugged into the con circuit. you should talk to mstanislav

2014-06-19 15:56:00	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: yeah, me too... I would like soccer much more if they started taking time off the clock during an "injury"
2014-06-19 15:57:19	Jerknette	then the coach would be encouraged to get the injured player off the field quicker, and they would fake injuries less, too
2014-06-19 16:13:44	soehlert_	Jerknette: they add time. usually long faking is when they're trying to waste time which is why they do the "added time"/"injury time" thing at the end of halves

2014-06-20 09:49:48	Jerknette	soehlert_: I don't think they should add time at the end.  basically I think if they want to waste time that's fine, but they won't get any time back
2014-06-20 09:51:54	soehlert_	Ya I kinda misrepresented that. All added time is at the refs discretion. They usually can tell when you're faking and don't really take that into account. Pretty much added time is for injuries requiring the stretcher and goal celebrations.
2014-06-20 11:23:38	Jerknette	soehlert_: what is there was a rule that if you're on the ground your coach HAS to put someone on the field to replace you
2014-06-20 11:23:58	Jerknette	as soon as you roll around you should be ushered off the field and have your replacement come in
2014-06-20 11:24:15	Jerknette	basically it would get at the pride of the athlete, because they don't want to miss out on the game
2014-06-20 11:46:35	soehlert_	ya with only 3 subs allowed that would NEVER fly. plus it does hurt like a bitch for about 30 seconds if someone steps on your foot or you knock knees
2014-06-20 11:47:20	soehlert_	there's no easy answer to this as much as soccer haters would love to simplify it. (i also saw someone get full on kicked in the calf today, stumble and keep running, but nobody cares about the fact that that happens..)
2014-06-20 11:47:57	soehlert_	some leagues have started doing retroactive cards, which might be the best answer. the league can give you a card after the game when they review the tape if they think you were diving

2014-06-24 13:47:15	soehlert_	the other question is, after we get it set up again, how come we have to get a new kerberos ticket even though our ticket is still good on this realm for 24 hours?

2014-07-01 10:12:58	soehlert_	Very excited. And I think we have somewhat decent odds. Belgium might be without two of their best players so that helps. 
2014-07-01 10:13:11	soehlert_	they also havent been playing nearly as good as they should have this whole cup

2014-07-01 11:02:35	WeeJay	soehlert_: do you knwo the history behind #10 being assigned to the top player?
2014-07-01 11:04:52	soehlert_	It's not to the top player, it's by position. historically each position had a number 1-11. About the only ones who still follow that usually are the 10 (the guy playing center attacking mid or second striker) and the 9 for an out and out striker
2014-07-01 11:06:01	soehlert_	it just so happens that a lot of the best players end up playing that 10 role
2014-07-01 11:07:16	WeeJay	soehlert_: http://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads/no-10-in-soccer.1282642/
2014-07-01 11:09:03	soehlert_	#5 is the correct answer
2014-07-01 11:09:22	soehlert_	you still hear people talk about playing "the number 6" all the time as a center defensive mid
2014-07-01 11:09:57	soehlert_	Answer #6 is going way back and also correct

2014-07-08 12:45:07	mostlybadfly	Nope. They sound good though
2014-07-08 12:46:47	Jerknette	they are so good, it's like Chinese "dumplings" - not real dumplings, but what "country" people call dumplings, and by country I mean white people of a certain socioeconomic status/culture
2014-07-08 12:47:23	Jerknette	imagine a large block of solid noodle dough, the cook has a very sharp knife and shaves off slivers of dough that fall into a giant soup pot
2014-07-08 12:47:40	Jerknette	let's them boil for a bit and puts them in a flavorful beef broth

2014-07-09 12:29:21	WeeJay	world cup seems fixed to me...we lost to Germany by one goal but a power house like brazil lost by 6 goals
2014-07-09 12:29:25	WeeJay	that make no sense
2014-07-09 12:30:08	soehlert_	sure it does. they played really fucking stupidly
2014-07-09 12:31:00	soehlert_	they were without their best defender, and played two guys in the back with no positional awareness. then they decided to only play with two central mids against 5 mids of germany (all who are REALLY good). then brazil played 4 guys up top who don't ever track back
2014-07-09 12:31:01	WeeJay	i did't get to watch the match :-( i was driving from MN
2014-07-09 12:31:55	soehlert_	basically they tactically set themselves up to see 5-3 every time germany got the ball. Brazil was also without their best player who could help hold onto the ball. their other guys were losing it left and right with dumb passes.
2014-07-09 13:07:26	Dop2___	and then they lost Hope.

2014-07-09 15:06:29	tljohnsn	For 15 minutes.
2014-07-09 15:21:04	Jerknette	tljohnsn: I'm sure that conversation cost more than $25
2014-07-09 15:21:15	Jerknette	probably a couple hundred because so many people were involved
2014-07-09 15:21:42	tljohnsn	My estimate is $187
2014-07-09 15:22:00	Jerknette	I'm picturing you in a green visor while you make that estimate
2014-07-09 15:22:07	Jerknette	with an old adding machine

2014-07-10 12:02:23	soehlert_	toyota park is a really nice place. and ya you can get some decent one off tickets for like 30 bucks
2014-07-10 12:03:07	soehlert_	my dad and i went a year or two ago and sat in the third row about midfield for that price. if we had paid 45 we woulda been in the section that had couches and food and whatnot right in front of us.

2014-07-10 12:03:28	soehlert_	would love to. need to find time to make it back, but we can figure something out.

2014-07-10 12:19:52	WeeJay	So i rescued a Compaq Portable (http://www.100megspopup.com/redawa/Graphics/CompaqPortable+.jpg) few years back and finally decided to put it up for donation.
2014-07-10 12:21:15	WeeJay	I found some compaq portable groups on the net and posted an ad for it.  My first caller turned out to be a guy from arizona who is afraid of "big brother" and he wants to write a program using this system which would act as a proxy between his modern computer and the internet to protect him from big brother.
2014-07-10 12:22:25	WeeJay	he has ambitious plans to build his own memory and mother board...  sounded a bit nutty but sounded like a guy who is genuinely interested in learning old tech

2014-07-14 10:00:31	Jerknette	buraglio_: how'd you make it out of the flood this past weekend?
2014-07-14 10:46:39	buraglio_	unscathed
2014-07-14 10:46:47	buraglio_	but I was sweating bullets for sure
2014-07-14 10:47:22	buraglio_	our sump pump ran for hours nonstop, and I don't have water damage insurance.  The last part is being fixed today
2014-07-14 10:47:45	buraglio_	I ran out as soon as it started and bought a backup sump pump

2014-07-14 11:02:40	buraglio_	Jerknette: can you find out the details ofthe video system for the brocon?
2014-07-14 11:03:14	buraglio_	Jerknette: and is the end time 5 central?
2014-07-14 11:04:30	Jerknette	buraglio_: yes, the conference is 9 to 5 central(breakfast at 8am), regarding the video system do you mean the webcast?  Mike Miller will give me that link and I'll send it to you for your coworkers
2014-07-14 11:04:52	Jerknette	or are you wanting to show a video during your presentation?
2014-07-14 11:06:12	buraglio_	no, just the webcast
2014-07-14 11:06:21	buraglio_	Just wondering what tech is it
2014-07-14 11:06:27	buraglio_	like adobe connect or whatever
2014-07-14 11:06:41	Jerknette	ah, I don't know
2014-07-14 11:06:52	buraglio_	no worries
2014-07-14 11:06:59	Jerknette	I think maybe Lync?
2014-07-14 11:07:10	buraglio_	they're just tying to get it set up at LBL.  They're super stoked that they can watch remotely
2014-07-14 11:07:14	Jerknette	we all use lync now, unless we dont' have to, because Microsoft...
2014-07-14 11:07:24	buraglio_	yeah, lync kinda bites ass
2014-07-14 11:07:33	buraglio_	at least on a mac
2014-07-14 11:07:39	buraglio_	it works freaking great on a windows system
2014-07-14 11:07:43	Jerknette	I'm sure
2014-07-14 11:07:54	Jerknette	MS outlook also sucks balls on a Mac
2014-07-14 11:08:03	buraglio_	oh yeah
2014-07-14 11:08:08	Jerknette	but the webmail client is the biggest turd I have ever encountered
2014-07-14 11:08:12	buraglio_	I'm happy that all of our stuff is google apps
2014-07-14 11:08:26	buraglio_	although a good amount of folks hate it for some reason
2014-07-14 11:08:35	Jerknette	yeah, because at its core it's supposed to work in a web browser
2014-07-14 11:08:44	mikede__	Jerknette: Go use the Notes web client then you will feel differently :P
2014-07-14 11:08:54	wort	Yup
2014-07-14 11:08:56	Jerknette	but MS stuff is supposed to work in clients and then maybe work online
2014-07-14 11:09:14	Jerknette	mikede__: never!  I have heard too many horror stories
2014-07-14 11:09:25	mikede__	Their web client for Exchange is pretty solid
2014-07-14 11:09:26	wort	With the Notes web client it is a crapshoot on which functionality works in which browser.
2014-07-14 11:09:31	buraglio_	does notes suck?  I always heard how awesome it was compared to like evernote
2014-07-14 11:09:42	mikede__	Unless you are running the lite version which I must ask WHY?!?!?!
2014-07-14 11:10:00	mikede__	More than likely it is how ours is setup at the bank
2014-07-14 11:10:03	mikede__	But it is pretty f'ing bad
2014-07-14 11:10:18	--	buraglio_ is now known as buraglio
2014-07-14 11:10:18	mikede__	The fat client is built-off of eclipse
2014-07-14 11:10:31	mikede__	Which makes it quite slow
2014-07-14 11:10:35	buraglio	outlook?
2014-07-14 11:10:50	mikede__	The connector was discontinued and is not supported
2014-07-14 11:11:12	buraglio	i never had too many issues running mail.app ad calendar with the uiuc exchange
2014-07-14 11:11:23	buraglio	I ran the lync client on my phone for calls and in the background for chat
2014-07-14 11:11:29	buraglio	although I never used it
2014-07-14 11:11:37	buraglio	the skype integration is pretty sweet, though.
2014-07-14 11:11:56	Jerknette	buraglio: really?  It doesn't scroll correctly through email, it jumps around on the screen, and it doesn't give me access to my email contacts
2014-07-14 11:11:59	buraglio	since I don't have a ync account anymore but I do have skype I can still add and chat with UIUC folks
2014-07-14 11:12:08	soehlert_	ya thunderbird works pretty great with exchange
2014-07-14 11:12:13	buraglio	you have to set up ldap sync for contacts
2014-07-14 11:12:35	buraglio	I never had any of the other issues and I had an absolutely gigantic mailbox
2014-07-14 11:12:41	Jerknette	can I set that in the client settings?
2014-07-14 11:12:51	soehlert_	you set it up in mail.app/thunderbird
2014-07-14 11:12:52	buraglio	no, it's in the contacts app
2014-07-14 11:13:00	soehlert_	errr thunderbird/contacts.app
2014-07-14 11:13:07	buraglio	yeah
2014-07-14 11:13:16	buraglio	I've never used thunderbird but I hear ood things
2014-07-14 11:13:19	buraglio	good
2014-07-14 11:13:28	Jerknette	I don't use thunderbird on my home machine, and I had some issue with thunderbird when I originally set it up here so I gave up
2014-07-14 11:13:35	soehlert_	i was having weird bugs with the threading in mail.app so i switched
2014-07-14 11:13:40	buraglio	I fucking hate email, though, really.  the best mail client ever is mutt
2014-07-14 11:13:45	soehlert_	pebkac?
2014-07-14 11:14:00	buraglio	heh
2014-07-14 11:14:15	Jerknette	buraglio: well, yeah, we shouldn't be on email anymore
2014-07-14 11:14:20	buraglio	I still maintain the mutt is the best, and I still use it from time to time
2014-07-14 11:15:22	Jerknette	at least internally, we should be using a web application similar to social networking sites, the wiki tools are moving in that direction, but they could do more to eliminate email entirely
2014-07-14 11:23:39	mikede__	There is a book out there talking about how WordPress.com works and they are almost completely no email

2014-07-16 09:51:41	Dop2___	yes.

2014-07-16 14:09:32	WeeJay	soehlert_: do you guys use any front-end to visualize bro output?
2014-07-16 14:09:45	soehlert_	splunk
2014-07-16 14:10:19	soehlert_	porque?
2014-07-16 14:10:30	WeeJay	what are some ways you consume the output other than just splunking it?  or do you drive all intelligence from splunk queries?
2014-07-16 14:10:42	WeeJay	just curious. im playing around with it because i am bored
2014-07-16 14:11:01	soehlert_	i never use splunk to be honest. i just use linux tools 
2014-07-16 14:11:13	soehlert_	but bossman likes splunk for the visual aspect
2014-07-16 14:11:33	WeeJay	have you developed any custom scripts?
2014-07-16 14:11:54	soehlert_	personally, yes, but its been a while. ncsa, tons
2014-07-16 14:13:32	WeeJay	looks like the scripts that ship with the default build are in perl :-(
2014-07-16 14:13:40	soehlert_	wait what?
2014-07-16 14:13:44	soehlert_	bro has its own language
2014-07-16 14:13:58	WeeJay	i looks very perlish
2014-07-16 14:14:18	soehlert_	meh i guess..it's not perl though.
2014-07-16 14:14:45	WeeJay	seems a bit strange to develop their own language
2014-07-16 14:15:12	WeeJay	but i am sure they had/have good reasons.
2014-07-16 14:15:19	soehlert_	why strange?
2014-07-16 14:15:37	Dop2___	It was the smartest thing they could have done.
2014-07-16 14:15:41	WeeJay	just seems like extra effort ..they could have just stuck with Lua
2014-07-16 14:15:49	WeeJay	Dop2___: how so?
2014-07-16 14:16:02	soehlert_	was lua around in 94?
2014-07-16 14:16:19	WeeJay	no idea.
2014-07-16 14:16:27	Dop2___	created in 93, about the same time.
2014-07-16 14:16:28	soehlert_	cuz that's when bro was started.
2014-07-16 14:16:31	Dop2___	So not really.
2014-07-16 14:16:46	WeeJay	does explain the perl influence.
2014-07-16 14:16:52	WeeJay	syntax is totally perl
2014-07-16 14:17:08	Dop2___	except that all of the array and type structures are totally different.
2014-07-16 14:17:12	Dop2___	:)
2014-07-16 14:17:20	Dop2___	and it's event based.
2014-07-16 14:21:47	WeeJay	soehlert_: so you get alerted by splunk or bro when events occur?  And then you use standard unix tools to look through the logs?
2014-07-16 14:22:27	soehlert_	no alerts from splunk. just bro alerts. then i use standard unix tools
2014-07-16 14:26:12	WeeJay	DO you guys actually perform any blocking using scripts based on bro events?  Or bro mostly used for passive detection?
2014-07-16 14:26:33	soehlert_	we are currently blocking ~70,000ips from bro
2014-07-16 14:26:49	soehlert_	working on adaptive blocking too, ie, repeat offenders get longer blocks 
2014-07-16 14:26:59	WeeJay	thats cool.
2014-07-16 14:28:06	WeeJay	bro does not appear to have blocking capability ...since it is event neutral. so I am assuming you guys have added some code to your script to trigger the blocks?
2014-07-16 14:28:40	WeeJay	just trying to understand how you utilize bro within your security portfolio..
2014-07-16 14:29:13	soehlert_	bro can execute any script so just a couple lines of bro code and it launches a bash/python/perl script
2014-07-16 14:30:19	WeeJay	are you feeding the intelligence from bro into any other active/passive system like Snort?
2014-07-16 14:30:33	soehlert_	cif
2014-07-16 14:30:48	WeeJay	CIF? classified info?
2014-07-16 14:30:56	WeeJay	sorry not down with the lingo
2014-07-16 14:31:16	soehlert_	https://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/
2014-07-16 14:31:38	WeeJay	woah! never heard of it. cool. let me check it out.
2014-07-16 14:33:44	WeeJay	this is interesting.  I saw many commercial vendors try to sell something similar to us.
2014-07-16 14:34:23	WeeJay	except the server is hosted in their cloud and they aggregated the intelligence from all their customers.
2014-07-16 14:34:53	soehlert_	you can run your own server
2014-07-16 14:35:10	soehlert_	and you can choose what feeds to use
2014-07-16 14:35:25	WeeJay	Dude you guys are doing some cool cutting edge stuff.
2014-07-16 14:37:35	WeeJay	The feeds coming out of CIF, are there many formats to support popular IDS/IPS/FW?  Or is that left up to you to do the data munging?
2014-07-16 14:37:49	soehlert_	not sure to be honest. i didnt have a hand in the backend cif stuff

2014-07-21 13:23:52	soehlert_	i can come over and wreck my liver if that adds any motivation

2014-07-21 15:59:54	Dop2___	hahahha
2014-07-21 16:00:03	Dop2___	that could be my new favorite.
2014-07-21 16:00:51	Dop2___	we had a risk assesmsnet thing the other day where the lowest level was urgent.  Then it was critical, very critical, extremely critical.
2014-07-21 16:01:56	soehlert_	hahah ya barlow was complaining about that the other day. everything is called critical just so someone will look into it
2014-07-21 16:04:44	mikede__	I don't get why people just set the security ratings to "fix" or "don't fix"
2014-07-21 16:04:48	mikede__	Because that is really all that matters
2014-07-21 16:04:52	mikede__	To logical I guess
2014-07-21 16:05:23	soehlert_	well that's how it ends up, but until you look at it you don't know if you're going to accept the risk or not right?
2014-07-21 16:06:36	mikede__	Sure
2014-07-21 16:07:10	mikede__	But from a security testing perspective it would just be easier for us to say we want you to fix these. These other items would be nice to have but you don't have to really fix them at this point.
2014-07-21 16:07:46	mikede__	I know not everything is tied to security testing
2014-07-21 16:08:22	mikede__	Doesn't mean that a person has to fix it just saying from a security perspective we could either say "hey these things we think you should fix"
2014-07-21 16:09:07	soehlert_	oh i agree from that side. i guess i just see the ratings needed for before security looks at them. after security sees them i can see just using a fix or dont fix rating system
2014-07-21 16:10:41	mikede__	Even then you don't need these silly things like extremely critical
2014-07-21 16:10:54	soehlert_	oh totally agreed. high medium low
2014-07-21 16:11:25	mikede__	It is not fixing the problem. Which is everyone inflates their findings or we are flooded with "urgent" issues and people don't listen.
2014-07-21 16:12:04	soehlert_	agreed. which is why it will always be broken. everyone wants the attention for themselves or are super lazy and at the other end of the spectrum. nobody is willing to just be in the middle

2014-07-31 12:03:59	soehlert_	oops WeeJay you weren't around when I responded to you about the syslog stuff. "didn't want to ship it across the network, wanted to log it locally. but log4j seemingly expects to send it to a listener instead of /dev/log
2014-07-31 12:04:26	tljohnsn	Dop is getting stuff ready for a presentation - what's the pki question?
2014-07-31 12:04:31	WeeJay	soehlert_: ah! got it.
2014-07-31 12:05:46	WeeJay	If a client sends a fully chained cert to a server for auth, does the server ONLY query the root CA to validate the entire chain or does it query every intermediate CA as well?
2014-07-31 12:07:43	tljohnsn	I think normally the client would need to send the chain, and then it would validate the whole chain against whatever is in the root store.
2014-07-31 12:08:01	tljohnsn	but not 100% sure.
2014-07-31 12:08:55	WeeJay	yes, i am not either.  we are renewing an intermediate cert and i want to be absolutely certain that it won't break any of the clients.  The root cert is untouched
2014-07-31 12:09:05	tljohnsn	That is how it's supposed to work when clients validate servers, but for servers validating clients I'd imagine it will work the same.
2014-07-31 12:10:15	tljohnsn	Is the intermediate stored already at the server?  You could import the new intermediate possibly.
2014-07-31 12:12:57	WeeJay	and that is my big concern.  If I update the intermediate cert on the server, will it still accept certs issued by the expiring intermediate cert.
2014-07-31 12:13:37	tljohnsn	Can it store both the old and the new?
2014-07-31 12:13:45	WeeJay	according to microsoft, yes....but we are dealing with a very old RSA appliance which has failed us in the past on such standard PKI assumptions
2014-07-31 12:14:15	WeeJay	can it store both...hmmm...i am not sure...the interface does not offer the option but i am sure i can just concatenate the cert on the filesystem.
2014-07-31 12:14:20	WeeJay	so that is an option to keep in mind.
2014-07-31 12:14:52	tljohnsn	I'm thinking that if you can't store both, you will be f'd since the server will have no way to validate unless the intermediate is sent by the client.
2014-07-31 12:15:31	tljohnsn	Hopefully there is a test system :)
2014-07-31 12:15:39	WeeJay	fortunately i always exported the client cert with full chain except for the mainframe client
2014-07-31 12:16:32	WeeJay	yes there is BUT since there is only one intermediate CA which is used by prod and test (poor decision which predates me) we could be impacting prod

2014-08-04 13:48:27	mikede__	I use quite a bit
2014-08-04 13:48:44	mikede__	CoffeeScript is ok but is probably over kill for what you are doing
2014-08-04 13:49:04	mikede__	If you want to use some of the newer stuff go with a JavaScript framework like Angular or Express.js
2014-08-04 13:49:35	mikede__	After the learning curve it would be pretty easy to do what you need to do
2014-08-04 13:54:25	mostlybadfly	Yeah I thought I could eyeball what to do but it's probably best to learn it for real haha
2014-08-04 13:55:21	mikede__	Depends on if you want to web dev in the near future or just play around
2014-08-04 13:57:14	mostlybadfly	I have a code school trial and they cover JS Angular and Coffeescript in. Their JS path so I'm going to really dig into that
2014-08-04 13:58:00	mostlybadfly	Definitely the former. I guess I know it's a big part but have yet to use it as part of web dev . I've only learned JS stuff in a console
2014-08-04 14:03:14	mikede__	Only one way to learn :)
2014-08-04 14:16:22	mostlybadfly	Yeah I'm intentionally making random apps for this reason
2014-08-04 14:16:55	mostlybadfly	I did a to do list so I can make a list of other projects I want to do. It looks how I want but now I'll see what I can make it do with js

2014-08-05 09:32:03	Jerknette	mikede__: you lost me, how is "protection" different than a condom in this scenario?
2014-08-05 09:33:10	soehlert_	he's saying you could agree to go on the pill or do something else. so style of protection vs style of condom
2014-08-05 09:40:36	buraglio	Jerknette: still waiting for DoE approval
2014-08-05 09:40:49	Jerknette	what the what?
2014-08-05 09:40:54	Jerknette	gubment
2014-08-05 09:41:32	Jerknette	soehlert_: the pill doesn't protect me from the clap
2014-08-05 09:42:01	buraglio	the big pill and the swab in the wiener?
2014-08-05 09:42:46	Jerknette	Chlamydia
2014-08-05 09:43:01	Jerknette	I think that's the slang term for it
2014-08-05 09:43:20	Jerknette	buraglio: are you trying to tell us you had the clap?
2014-08-05 09:45:49	soehlert_	i was presuming protection from the worst of all STDs..
2014-08-05 09:46:41	buraglio	no way
2014-08-05 09:46:52	buraglio	can't be proven
2014-08-05 09:47:08	Jerknette	not anymore, since you eradicated it from your wee-hole
2014-08-05 09:47:11	buraglio	worst of all STDs is AIDS man, not ghnorrhea
2014-08-05 09:49:24	buraglio	Jerknette: didn't you live in waterson towers?
2014-08-05 09:49:42	buraglio	AKA chlamydia towers?
2014-08-05 09:50:28	buraglio	when I was at ISU there was like a 40% take rate with chlamydia at waterson
2014-08-05 09:53:28	Jerknette	buraglio: you were a swinging bachelor, I was a nerd that nobody wanted to screw, except Dop2___
2014-08-05 09:53:40	soehlert_	buraglio: i was talking about babies
2014-08-05 09:59:20	buraglio	Na, I had a girlfriend all through college
2014-08-05 09:59:37	Jerknette	and you still got an STD?  low class
2014-08-05 10:00:12	Jerknette	PSA: it's only cool to slutshame buraglio , not others
2014-08-05 10:05:27	buraglio	I've never had an STD, FWIW
2014-08-05 10:05:47	buraglio	I am morally ambiguous in many ways, but not that one.
2014-08-05 10:20:02	Jerknette	boo, so serious!
2014-08-05 10:27:32	buraglio	heh
2014-08-05 11:01:22	mikede__	@Jerknette because depending on the protection it is better or worse. For instance the timing method isn't as good as a condom. Where as most condoms all offer the same level of protection.
2014-08-05 11:02:07	soehlert_	see Jerknette I told you we were talking babies not the HIV
2014-08-05 11:02:56	mikede__	Either way
2014-08-05 11:03:00	mikede__	I was talking both
2014-08-05 11:03:19	mikede__	The timing method won't protect you from STDs but it does offer some protection from babies
2014-08-05 11:03:22	mikede__	yada yada yada
2014-08-05 11:06:13	soehlert_	don't let her be right at all, that won't go well for anyone
2014-08-05 11:06:48	mikede__	I am not scared of Jerknette
2014-08-05 11:07:53	mikede__	And she was right but just with one "cipher" :)
2014-08-05 11:11:31	mostlybadfly	Condom with birth control is the best way
2014-08-05 11:13:44	soehlert_	double bag it is the only answer
2014-08-05 11:15:14	mostlybadfly	I wonder how effective birth control is vs a condom
2014-08-05 11:15:23	mikede__	Praying to the sperm gods is the best way
2014-08-05 11:15:49	mostlybadfly	Just keep it in your pants you heathens
2014-08-05 11:16:09	mikede__	that too
2014-08-05 11:16:48	mostlybadfly	I'm just glad I have no wombs involved over here
2014-08-05 11:38:13	Jerknette	mostlybadfly: birth control vs condom is something like 99.7% vs 97%, if I remember what I learned in sex ed correctly
2014-08-05 11:38:58	Jerknette	#sadpacket get off my back, Dop2___ started this nonsense in the first place by insisting I report our chat to sadpacket
2014-08-05 11:47:37	mikede__	Do you need a hug Jerknette?
2014-08-05 12:15:40	buraglio	heh
2014-08-05 12:15:45	buraglio	condoms suck
2014-08-05 12:15:53	buraglio	no one uses them anymore
2014-08-05 12:16:48	buraglio	pulling out also sucks
2014-08-05 12:16:58	buraglio	unless you're going for distance
2014-08-05 12:20:14	Jerknette	buraglio: there's the Nick we know and love
2014-08-05 12:21:22	Jerknette	mikede__: where does the hug rest in the SSL handshake scenario?
2014-08-05 12:23:15	buraglio	I mean, lets; be honest, a rubber is just about as good as putting a tarp on your dong and it's gonna break anyway
2014-08-05 12:24:05	buraglio	and pulling out is just going to make a mess, may as well just creampie it.
2014-08-05 12:54:45	Jerknette	I'm afraid to look that up at work
2014-08-05 12:56:11	soehlert_	no worries, just do it on the wired network and let me laugh at it.
2014-08-05 12:56:47	Jerknette	ha, okay boss
2014-08-05 12:57:06	soehlert_	i mean we're the only ones who would notice you doing that..
2014-08-05 12:57:50	Jerknette	well then why don't you look it up
2014-08-05 12:58:09	soehlert_	cuz im not a 30something yr old woman who somehow doesn't know what it means
2014-08-05 12:59:26	Jerknette	34, or thirty-faux if you're a Sex and the City fan
2014-08-05 12:59:32	soehlert_	i am not

2014-08-05 14:26:28	soehlert_	?
2014-08-05 14:26:44	Dop2___	nothing really... just you know...  making conversation.
2014-08-05 14:26:59	soehlert_	well thats a terrible conversation starter
2014-08-05 14:27:22	soehlert_	i got the ok to start doing pen testing at work now. though im not going to be able to get to it for a while, i'm excited to start doing it 
2014-08-05 14:28:29	Dop2___	awesome.  and you actually have the power to turn shit off if they don't fix it.
2014-08-05 14:29:12	soehlert_	indeed. and warren already offered to purchase software if needed. though i dont think i'll take him up on that to start. unless you think burp is that much better than zap
2014-08-05 14:29:50	Dop2___	that would be a mikede__ question.
2014-08-05 14:30:17	Dop2___	you can probably go a long way with something that just tests for default creds everywhere.
2014-08-05 14:30:26	Dop2___	work from the low hanging fruit up.
2014-08-05 14:30:28	soehlert_	we used zap in my sans class and it seemed to do most everything burp does
2014-08-05 14:30:38	Dop2___	Bernie's gone now right?
2014-08-05 14:30:49	soehlert_	but ya that's probably how i'll start. we were linked to the pen testing framework so i might follow that for starters
2014-08-05 14:30:52	soehlert_	haha ya.
2014-08-05 14:56:50	mikede__	What is a mikede question?
2014-08-05 14:57:13	mikede__	Oh zap vs. burp
2014-08-05 14:57:23	soehlert_	yup
2014-08-05 14:58:06	mikede__	Whatever floats your boat
2014-08-05 14:58:11	mikede__	I need to try zap some more
2014-08-05 14:58:28	mikede__	But my guess is they are about the same and still stuck in the late 00s
2014-08-05 14:58:32	soehlert_	thats what it's sounded like and i'd rather not make him find money in the budget for burp and then find out it wasnt necessary
2014-08-05 14:58:51	soehlert_	maybe id outgrow it eventaully but off the bat seems unnecessary
2014-08-05 15:23:02	Dop2___	you know what you'll never outgrow, Sam?
2014-08-05 15:23:10	soehlert_	is it my hands dop?

2014-08-06 12:08:00	soehlert_	because you actually are the one making them and selling them? are you trying to promote your brand here?

2014-08-06 12:11:04	Jerknette	ooh!  panel question: as a parent do you introduce your kids to SW in fictional chronological order, film chronological order, or the restructured order that nerds talk about every once and a while
2014-08-06 12:11:45	soehlert_	You start them with the soon to be released one, and then 3,2,1 and then nothing because you're a dick of a parent
2014-08-06 12:11:54	soehlert_	general you there.
2014-08-06 12:12:10	Jerknette	ha
2014-08-06 12:12:23	Jerknette	I hand't anticipated the "be a dick parent" option
2014-08-06 12:12:33	soehlert_	have you met me?
2014-08-06 12:13:11	Jerknette	yeah, you'd be a terrible parent
2014-08-06 12:13:24	soehlert_	this is why im just going to be uncle sam
2014-08-06 12:14:08	Jerknette	and to bring the conversation back around to yesterday, that makes more sense that you double bag it
2014-08-06 12:14:36	soehlert_	double bagging is just smart. twice the protection!
2014-08-06 12:14:49	Jerknette	more is moar
2014-08-06 12:15:56	mikede__	http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheNerdParentsGuideWhenAndHowToIntroduceYourKidsToStarWars.aspx to answer your question Jerknette
2014-08-06 12:17:36	Jerknette	"Show the films in "Machete Order" which is episodes 4,5,2,3,6. This maintains surprises while ending on a high note.
2014-08-06 12:17:36	Jerknette	Yes, episode 1 is hacked out and not shown. You can show it at the end of it all along with the Clone Wars cartoons and bill them as supplemental material." I love the part about episode 1... man that movie sucked
2014-08-06 12:22:22	mikede__	And yes I am a star wars fan
2014-08-06 12:22:26	mikede__	I like a ton of movies
2014-08-06 12:25:48	Dop2___	I think I've only seen episode 2 and 3 one time each.
2014-08-06 14:50:21	mostlybadfly	I've only seen star wars like once

2014-08-12 13:27:17	kevN	I think 360 is a good sales event
2014-08-12 13:27:28	kevN	because there are a lot of non-security companies that send people

2014-08-12 14:47:54	wort	Yeah
2014-08-12 14:48:17	yoberi	I read that, but you need to keys that are already known/trusted.
2014-08-12 14:48:30	kevN	I thought you could buy a compatible key
2014-08-12 14:48:31	kevN	cut it
2014-08-12 14:48:40	kevN	then use the programming sequence to trust it
2014-08-12 14:48:47	yoberi	I bought a used car, found out as they handed me the key after paying and paperwork that it was the ONLY key.
2014-08-12 14:48:56	kevN	Yeah, kind of in the same boat
2014-08-12 14:49:10	kevN	I cut a second key for my car to get into it
2014-08-12 14:49:12	kevN	but it can't start it
2014-08-12 14:49:13	yoberi	to keys = two keys.
2014-08-12 14:49:48	yoberi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv0H-vPoDc
2014-08-12 14:49:59	kevN	what make is your van?
2014-08-12 14:50:17	yoberi	chrysler town and country
2014-08-12 14:51:26	yoberi	not coming to cotc again... you may lose your platinum card for fort Dop.
2014-08-12 14:51:39	kevN	Dop keeps scheduling it without consulting me
2014-08-12 14:51:51	yoberi	All I hear is a lame excuse
2014-08-12 14:52:07	kevN	Ha, did you see what it would cost to have the dealer do a valet key vs a master
2014-08-12 14:52:50	yoberi	I asked them, but forgot the exact amount. It still involved the $99 programming fee so I balked
2014-08-12 14:53:55	kevN	Have you thought about having someone disassemble the existing key and putting the chip into the steering columb
2014-08-12 14:54:00	yoberi	I need you to learn how to clone the rfid or at least add the UID to the security system. I think a guy like you could figure out how to do something like that.
2014-08-12 14:54:03	kevN	reverting it to a traditional key system?
2014-08-12 14:54:08	yoberi	I have.
2014-08-12 14:54:26	kevN	it's kind of scary to break apart the working key without a spare though
2014-08-12 14:54:31	yoberi	But I haven't figured out if the rfid is in the same module as the keyless entry
2014-08-12 14:54:41	yoberi	I like keyless entry too much.
2014-08-12 14:54:44	kevN	gotcha
2014-08-12 14:54:55	soehlert_	kevN: You got a back up old jeep or something at least dont you?
2014-08-12 14:55:05	kevN	Jeep is dead.
2014-08-12 14:55:09	kevN	Sarah's CRV exists.
2014-08-12 14:55:15	yoberi	If the modules are separate, I wouldn't be against that.
2014-08-12 14:55:20	soehlert_	what happened to the jeep?
2014-08-12 14:55:39	kevN	lots of flashy lights and seemingly bad fuel injection
2014-08-12 14:55:45	kevN	didn't pay to have it actually diagnosed
2014-08-12 14:56:01	soehlert_	just letting it slowly rust to death in your driveway?
2014-08-12 14:56:14	kevN	donated to karz4kids
2014-08-12 14:56:27	kevN	will live on as a 2014 tax deduction
2014-08-12 14:56:36	soehlert_	ah 
2014-08-12 14:56:39	yoberi	gotta step out and go to the lab. Good cahtting with ya, kevN. Say hi to Sarah for me.

2014-09-09 14:39:11	soehlert_	jesus christ, that's one hell of a way to take a compliment!
2014-09-09 14:39:33	Jerknette	yeah, but I spelled it wrong, see?
2014-09-09 14:39:48	Jerknette	where are you, anyway?
2014-09-09 14:39:56	mostlybadfly	It doesn't mean anything if its spelled wrong
2014-09-09 14:40:53	mostlybadfly	Stop bening a damn bby
2014-09-09 14:40:59	soehlert_	im at npcf yet again. for the forseeable future as well
2014-09-09 14:41:06	Jerknette	damn
2014-09-09 14:41:20	Jerknette	wanna meet for lunch on Friday?
2014-09-09 14:41:27	Jerknette	you could probably use the opportunity to warm up
2014-09-09 14:41:53	soehlert_	possibly an option. that's very far in advance and im not sure what i'll be doing at 3pm today.
2014-09-09 14:43:20	Jerknette	whoa!  that's like 17 minutes from now
2014-09-09 14:43:33	Jerknette	you should probably keep on keepin' on
2014-09-09 14:44:16	soehlert_	i just mean i suck at planning, but likely yes we can do that
2014-09-09 14:53:56	soehlert_	i don't do calendar invites
2014-09-09 14:54:16	soehlert_	mostly because thunderbird won't let me accept them and i don't want to log into webmail
2014-09-09 15:00:54	Jerknette	soehlert_: ah, but how do you know your schedule if you don't do invites?
2014-09-09 15:05:16	soehlert_	i have two continuous calendar invites. any other one off thing is simply remembered. that's how i make sure i know it's important
2014-09-09 15:22:51	Jerknette	soehlert_: so your gauge of whether something is important is merely if you remember?  I forget meetings, I need a reminder
2014-09-09 15:23:04	Jerknette	especially if the meeting is a one-off
2014-09-09 15:23:59	soehlert_	well i don't have one off meetings ever. my one off things are like doctors appointments and whatnot
2014-09-09 15:24:10	soehlert_	so any time theres a one off, i know it's important and that helps me remember it

2014-09-22 14:08:26	Dop2___	it can't ALL be mstanislav__ 's travel budget.
2014-09-22 14:09:23	soehlert_	i was curious about that as well
2014-09-22 14:09:48	Dop2___	the article says a little bit.

2014-09-22 16:48:34	mstanislav__	we were ~35 people when i started may, 2013. we will be 100 end of year.
2014-09-22 16:48:56	mstanislav__	that ramp will continue upwards and not plateau any time soon.

2014-09-23 09:48:38	buraglio	I am a fan of dou and have been using it for years
2014-09-23 09:50:15	mstanislav__	yeah, it's pretty easy to work here because we rarely find people who just "don't like us" or our product. i can't imagine the same is true for most infosec vendors ;)
2014-09-23 09:51:09	mstanislav__	lots of cool stuff coming out next quarter, too, and a few skunkworksy things i'm really excited to have eventually hit our product.
2014-09-23 09:51:31	buraglio	cool
2014-09-23 09:51:53	buraglio	well, I think it really helps to be flexible. Most security products are essentially built fo rthe enterprise
2014-09-23 09:52:02	buraglio	and don't work for much else
2014-09-23 09:53:12	buraglio	the same is true for network to a lesser extent.  The products that have little to no competition or are robust enough to survive in miltiple markets like service provider, R&E, etc. seem to do well
2014-09-23 09:53:24	buraglio	multiple*
2014-09-23 09:56:09	buraglio	there is actually merit to expanding to Champaign, actually.  A basically never ending stream of inexpensive, motivated and pre-vetted code monkeys
2014-09-23 09:56:21	buraglio	also it's cheap as fuck to have space here
2014-09-23 09:57:03	mstanislav__	hehe. yeah we're pretty tightly knit in ann arbor. *most* of our folks not here are localized for a reason (VPs, executive sales) but we've moved a lot of people here
2014-09-23 09:57:52	mstanislav__	boston, portland, san francisco, Minnesota represent like 5? people total. i think that's it for remote workers.
2014-09-23 09:57:56	buraglio	you have the same advantage there, actually.  The only real disadvantage is that it's Ann Arbor.
2014-09-23 09:58:29	mstanislav__	one of dug's goals was to keep the company here since the others he worked for (primarily barracuda/arbor networks) really relocated for the most part
2014-09-23 09:58:54	buraglio	that's cool.
2014-09-23 09:59:08	mstanislav__	him and his wife are part of like a couple dozen initiatives, organizations, etc. in the area and have been for years. he's pretty passionate as far as enthusiasm for a city goes.
2014-09-23 09:59:16	buraglio	I can totally repspect that as someone that is stuck in Champaign
2014-09-23 10:00:02	mstanislav__	in fact, he's a BIG skateboarder and over the last 10? years was the primary person who got a skatepark finally funded and built here. just opened this spring. tony hawk, et al was here
2014-09-23 10:00:23	buraglio	I like it here but also hate it.  It's a total dichotomy

2014-10-31 13:47:20	tljohnsn	Anyone running any really new linux distros?  Apparently  they added a -r option to ln and I'm trying to figure out what it is for.
2014-10-31 13:47:50	tljohnsn	Or maybe not really new, but less than 4 years old or so.
2014-10-31 13:50:04	soehlert_	im on centos 6.5
2014-10-31 13:50:56	soehlert_	but ya i dont see it on the manpages
2014-10-31 13:51:02	tljohnsn	This crap is from centos 7
2014-10-31 13:51:20	tljohnsn	Which I haven't installed anywhere yet.
2014-10-31 13:51:44	soehlert_	where are you seeing the -r?
2014-10-31 13:51:52	soehlert_	and why is it not in the manpage
2014-10-31 13:54:08	tljohnsn	I am trying to build nss src.rpm from c7 on c6, and it's in the .spec
2014-10-31 13:54:36	tljohnsn	I just took the -r option out, and hoping it will be fine...
2014-10-31 13:56:56	soehlert_	ah gotcha. ya i don't have a c7 host yet or id look sorry 
2014-10-31 13:57:11	tljohnsn	Sigh it bombed....
2014-10-31 13:59:51	soehlert_	just make a c7 vm real quick
2014-10-31 14:01:45	tljohnsn	I think it might make a relative symlink given an absolute path by looking at what the .spec is doing
2014-10-31 14:02:22	tljohnsn	Yeah, that will involve downloading isos and shit, which I was hoping to avoid....
2014-10-31 14:04:39	tljohnsn	If this doesn't work, I guess I could just update my workstation to c7....  Gonna have to do that someday anyway.
2014-10-31 14:12:53	soehlert_	i guess that makes sense. i cant see why you'd need that, but it sounds plausible. fair enough. ooo thats scary though
2014-10-31 14:13:43	tljohnsn	Yay - it built by just changing the ln -r to cd $BUILDROOT ln
2014-10-31 14:13:52	soehlert_	hahah nicely done

2014-11-19 10:27:33	soehlert_	Also, free happy hours all weekend with appetizers was pretty great. I ended up riding a mechanical bull, singing god awful karaoke, and having a circle formed around me so i could show off the dance moves.

2014-11-19 11:03:33	Dop2___	how was the mech bull?

2014-11-19 11:04:04	soehlert_	that was my second time. there's video evidence on facebook. i did pretty well. my legs hurt like a bitch though after. nice and bruised
2014-11-19 11:10:23	Dop2___	I figured it would be rough on the boys.
2014-11-19 11:12:25	soehlert_	not too bad on that, it's lower. probably because i use lower thigh to hold myself up to avoid hurtin the boys

2014-12-11 14:48:16	mostlybadfly	It is nothing fancy.  Probably considered bottom rung but at least I'll look at ruby

2014-12-11 15:48:17	mstanislav	eh, duo and me never really meshed. i loveeee the company and product, but roles there just weren't what they should have been.
2014-12-11 15:48:34	mstanislav	after i had pivoted to security project manager thought it would be different but was a pretty big let down
2014-12-11 15:48:50	mstanislav	they aren't quite ready to have a "labs" team at a company that small and in such flux leadership wise.
2014-12-11 15:49:11	mstanislav	rapid7 had been trying to get me for months now and i have a lot of friends over there. great role came up and good timing all around so i took it
2014-12-11 15:49:42	mstanislav	now i'm WFH, some client travel, dedicated research time, events budget, great pay increase, amazing and well respected team, and ground floor for their newest organization
2014-12-11 15:49:45	mstanislav	all around ++
2014-12-11 15:55:48	mikede	Sounds like a great opportunity
2014-12-11 15:56:19	soehlert_	awesome man. congrats
2014-12-11 15:56:30	soehlert_	so reserch time just means do whatever sounds cool?

2014-12-11 16:17:07	soehlert_	that sounds like fun
2014-12-11 16:17:26	soehlert_	thats one thing i really dig about here. i can tell warren, hey this sounds cool im gonna try it out to see if it helps.
2014-12-11 16:20:32	Dop2___	technically I'm the Rapid7 relationship manager for US Bank.
2014-12-11 16:20:46	soehlert_	we don't have one, but we should probably get one.
2014-12-11 16:21:39	soehlert_	i mean we'll probably start using metasploit in the nearish future.
2014-12-11 16:30:32	mstanislav	I'm on strategic services, specifically security program development for organizations
2014-12-11 16:31:26	Dop2___	Shmoocon?
2014-12-11 16:31:37	Dop2___	Jeannette, Kevin, and I should all be there.

2015-01-09 12:48:26	Dop2___	So, thoughts...   the heavy bag in the garage is mounted to the central beam.  When I hit it and the garage door is closed, it makes some rattling noises which are annoying and probably not good for the longevity of the door.
2015-01-09 12:48:37	Dop2___	 I planning on getting a freestanding heavy bag stand.
2015-01-09 12:48:56	Dop2___	However... do I bolt it to the concrete floor or just use weights (which I'd have to buy) to hold it down?
2015-01-09 12:49:16	Dop2___	I'm afraid even if I bolt it the continued impact will cause the concrete to crack.
2015-01-09 13:05:30	soehlert	I would think the bolting would cause it to crack more
2015-01-09 13:24:35	soehlert	then again, shouldn't this be in your wheelhouse?

2015-01-09 15:52:11	soehlert	can you build some sort of structure to hold the heavy bag thats just heavy as fuck so you dont need to bolt it?

2015-02-11 13:21:47	soehlert	considering O'Hare is the busiest airport in the US, there's no way the airlines would let that happen
2015-02-11 13:22:31	Dop_	but it's pretty great the rule is from 2005 and IL just hasn't done shit about it.  :)
2015-02-11 13:22:40	Dop_	ignore it until it's someone else's problem.
2015-02-11 13:22:46	soehlert	it would have cost us money

2015-02-27 13:56:41	Dop_	okay, more on the OS X mystery.  it seems to be related to when applications want to access security settings.
2015-02-27 13:57:26	Dop_	This time it was a new application I wanted to use and it wouldn't open the "This app came from the internet blaa blaa" dialog until I restarted.
2015-02-27 13:58:30	soehlert_	ok thats messed up.
2015-02-27 13:58:36	soehlert_	you should get a new computer

2015-02-27 14:11:24	soehlert_	what was the idea there?
2015-02-27 14:27:03	Dop_	I'm hoping it's the stupid virus software we're suppose to keep installed.
