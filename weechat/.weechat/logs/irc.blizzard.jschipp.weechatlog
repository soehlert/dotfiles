2014-12-17 12:14:29	jschipp	are you wanting to do the SEC replacement project? I would be interested in taking it over if you don't want it
2014-12-17 12:31:13	soehlert	depends on what you mean. are you talking about moving all the SEC stuff into OSSEC or trying something new?
2014-12-17 12:36:46	jschipp	I talked to Warren and Icepick yesterday and they were fine with using Sagan and said I would just have to talk to you about doing the project
2014-12-17 12:37:14	jschipp	I plan on keeping OSSEC for general HIDS but doing nearly all the log analysis with Sagan
2014-12-17 12:37:50	jschipp	OSSEC would stay the same, SEC would be replaced with Sagan
2014-12-17 12:45:12	jschipp	It would all stay on analysis-sec so I can easily integrate it with CIF
2014-12-17 12:46:21	soehlert	if warrens cool with it then have at it
2014-12-17 12:46:44	jschipp	great, thanks
2014-12-17 14:09:55	soehlert	hey the only thing i thought of, is maybe we can do a two stage rollout. first replace all SEC stuff with sagan, and then once we are sure we like it that much better, then translate over the ossec rules
2014-12-17 14:30:30	jschipp	okay, we can try that
