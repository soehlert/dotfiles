2014-12-18 10:43:06	wardog	what happened with OSSEC rules?
2014-12-18 10:43:49	wardog	Was there an event that happened yesterday with a rule change/addition?
2014-12-18 10:50:56	soehlert	no but jon wanted to push that XSS rule and since i wasn't working tuesday it sounded like he was going to. we had to cancel that one before because it was continuously black holing Basneys stuff
2014-12-18 10:51:15	soehlert	and just in general i dont think he's necessarily thinking enough about the possible outcomes on an open network.
2014-12-18 10:51:41	soehlert	id like something a little more formal than just an irc note in passing about something as possible damaging to us as active response without thought
2014-12-18 10:55:48	wardog	I agree. With the report back from BW review we do have more of a need to formalize this.
2014-12-18 10:56:34	soehlert	so its nothing im freaking out about just thought we need to be more careful and im not entirely sure of th ebest way
2014-12-18 10:56:52	wardog	I'll add this to my queue and tackle writing up something over break and we'll discuss when we all return.
2014-12-18 10:57:25	soehlert	perfect thanks
2014-12-18 10:57:42	wardog	It's certainly something that needs to be formally addressed if we're going to start leveraging block info from CIF intel.
2014-12-18 10:58:05	soehlert	thats for sure. i think its because of the bad luck we've seemingly had with CIF in the past, but it makes me uneasy
2014-12-18 10:58:53	wardog	I agree.
