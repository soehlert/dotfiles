2014-04-21 14:33:06	jazoff	oh, different error
2014-04-21 14:36:07	jazoff	keist: ok, i think i fixed it
2014-04-21 14:39:25	keist	yay!, ty
2014-04-21 16:06:08	hypnotoad	anyone know if i can make a package depend on an array of packages
2014-04-21 16:06:16	hypnotoad	for example: $isshd_packages = [ "zlib-devel", "openssl-devel", "tcp_wrappers-devel", "pam-devel" ]
2014-04-21 16:06:36	hypnotoad	and then have isshd require => Packages[${isshd_packages}]
2014-04-21 16:10:20	jazoff	why does isshd depend on all of those?
2014-04-21 16:11:06	jazoff	(it shouldn't depend on any -devel packages)
2014-04-21 16:11:20	hypnotoad	its configured with tcp-wrappers and pam (requiring the headers only available in the devel packages) and the im not sure why on the other two, but it required headers only available in those
2014-04-21 16:11:22	jazoff	and any packages it depends on should be specified in fpm, then yum will just install them
2014-04-21 16:11:51	jazoff	requires headers to BUILD or to RUN?
2014-04-21 16:12:04	hypnotoad	ooo good point.i was basing this off building..
2014-04-21 16:12:07	hypnotoad	so nevermind
2014-04-21 16:12:23	jazoff	:)
2014-04-24 10:59:01	keist	anyone now how to do something like this in ruby? if [ "$IP_$NIC" =~ /141\.142\.148/
2014-04-24 10:59:10	keist	thinking something like : <% if @ipaddress_@int =~ /141\.142\.148/ %>
2014-04-24 10:59:44	keist	but I don't know if you can combine to variables liek that as you can in bash

2014-04-30 09:47:52	hypnotoad	If i want a package removed everywhere I would put it in common.yaml. However, what would happen if I then installed it in profile's yaml file? Would it do first match (ie the profile's yaml) and stop? Or would it do some weird install then remove thing?
2014-04-30 09:51:07	jazoff	you'll likely get a puppet error
2014-04-30 09:51:21	jazoff	duplicate resource defintion
2014-04-30 09:51:51	hypnotoad	thats what i was afraid of. it seems really dumb to have to add the remove package in every roles common file except one, but that's the only other idea i have
2014-04-30 09:52:22	jazoff	oh, you don't have to do that...
2014-04-30 09:52:30	hypnotoad	oh?
2014-04-30 09:52:31	jazoff	just OVERRIDE the remove list in the one hosts file
2014-04-30 09:52:35	jazoff	to not that have one package
2014-04-30 09:52:39	jazoff	still sucky, but less so
2014-04-30 09:53:01	jazoff	oooh wait, i dont think that works
2014-04-30 09:53:07	jazoff	heira merges lists
2014-04-30 09:53:07	hypnotoad	thats what i originally asked
2014-04-30 09:53:24	jazoff	noo you said install in one
2014-04-30 09:53:33	jazoff	which would be remove+install which definitely won't work
2014-04-30 09:53:37	jazoff	but I think if we have
2014-04-30 09:53:42	jazoff	common: remove = foo, bar,baz
2014-04-30 09:53:47	jazoff	host1: remove = foo, bar
2014-04-30 09:53:55	hypnotoad	ya thats basically what i actually meant to say
2014-04-30 09:53:57	jazoff	it will still remove baz because it does a union
2014-04-30 09:54:05	hypnotoad	but ya that wont help..
2014-04-30 09:54:10	hypnotoad	damn
2014-04-30 09:54:35	hypnotoad	this is why i dont like having other peoples' shit in our puppet. they find ways to make it not work..
2014-04-30 09:54:42	jazoff	thoughhh
2014-04-30 09:54:55	jazoff	you are doing packages::remove: [ "logwatch", "cups"
2014-04-30 09:55:03	jazoff	not sure if that parses the same as
2014-04-30 09:55:04	jazoff	packages::remove:
2014-04-30 09:55:07	jazoff	 - logwatch
2014-04-30 09:55:08	jazoff	 - cups
2014-04-30 09:55:21	hypnotoad	they're both arrays arent they?
2014-04-30 09:56:20	jazoff	might be
2014-04-30 09:57:32	jazoff	yeah, different synta, same result
2014-04-30 09:57:59	hypnotoad	meeting time. ill just dig into hiera overrides when were done, hopefully theres an easier way
2014-04-30 10:52:42	hypnotoad	jazoff: had an epiphany, just remove logwatch and cups in the kickstart so that any machine that wants it can install it and puppet wont fight them
2014-04-30 10:54:40	jazoff	that works
2014-04-30 10:55:10	hypnotoad	should work for anything that needs to be removed everywhere but a host or two

2014-05-12 15:20:28	hypnotoad	ok so vmware tools install puppet module should be turned on here right? 
2014-05-12 15:20:34	hypnotoad	hieradata/development/virtual/vmware.yaml
2014-05-12 15:36:48	jazoff	yeah
2014-05-12 15:37:19	jazoff	its based on   - "%{::environment}/virtual/%{::virtual}"
2014-05-12 15:37:36	jazoff	so if the 'virtual' fact is 'vmware' it will include that file
2014-05-12 15:38:46	hypnotoad	ahhh gotcha
2014-05-12 15:49:37	hypnotoad	does anyone know if you can negate an onlyif?
2014-05-12 15:50:58	hypnotoad	nevermind ill just use unless. didnt know that existed
2014-05-12 16:10:31	jazoff	unless is basically 'if not'
2014-05-12 16:14:18	hypnotoad	yup realized that once i found it. need to be more thorough when reading docs
2014-05-13 12:04:19	hypnotoad	i need another brain on this vmware_tools module real quick.
2014-05-13 13:13:06	jazoff	er
2014-05-13 13:13:15	jazoff	just noticed the little '4' in irssi :)
2014-05-13 13:13:19	jazoff	you still working on it?
2014-05-13 13:13:57	hypnotoad	i think i just figured out the logic. about to test
2014-05-13 13:14:17	hypnotoad	removing them takes forever to test again..
2014-05-13 13:17:22	jazoff	looks mostly good
2014-05-13 13:17:30	hypnotoad	haha mostly?
2014-05-13 13:17:32	jazoff	the package items should require the repo
2014-05-13 13:17:44	jazoff	it's not guaranteed to run top to bottom
2014-05-13 13:17:47	hypnotoad	they do..
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	  package{"vmware-tools-esx-kmods":
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	    ensure  => present,
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	    require => File["/etc/yum.repos.d/vmware-tools.repo"],
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	  }
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	  package{"vmware-tools-esx-nox":
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	    ensure  => present,
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	    require => Package["vmware-tools-esx-kmods"],
2014-05-13 13:17:56	hypnotoad	  }
2014-05-13 13:18:29	hypnotoad	if the repo isnt there then kmods doesn't get installed. if kmods doesn't get installed then nox doesn't either
2014-05-13 13:18:30	jazoff	oh, i'm blind
2014-05-13 13:18:48	hypnotoad	and it kills 2 birds with 1 stone since you need to install kmods first anyways
2014-05-13 13:19:16	jazoff	might be able to do the whole thing with those -> arrows
2014-05-13 13:19:50	hypnotoad	but then id have to learn how to use those :)
2014-05-13 13:19:55	jazoff	yeah :)
2014-05-13 13:20:00	jazoff	somtiems it ends up being easier
2014-05-13 13:20:06	jazoff	-> is basically depends and ~> is notifies
2014-05-13 13:20:21	hypnotoad	by depends do you mean requires or is depends its own thing
2014-05-13 13:20:43	jazoff	see modules/samplicate/manifests/init.pp
2014-05-13 13:21:00	jazoff	or how we did modules/fw/manifests/init.pp
2014-05-13 13:21:29	hypnotoad	right i get that part. just curious if depends was another type or whatever
2014-05-13 13:21:46	hypnotoad	which i suppose logic says it shouldn't be
2014-05-13 13:22:16	jazoff	ooh i mean depends as in 'requires' or 'before'
2014-05-13 13:22:29	hypnotoad	ok same page now
2014-05-13 13:22:30	jazoff	foo {...} -> bar { ... } is like
2014-05-13 13:22:44	jazoff	foo { before=> Bar[..]} 
2014-05-13 13:22:45	jazoff	or
2014-05-13 13:22:54	jazoff	bar { requires => Foo[..]}
2014-05-13 13:41:12	hypnotoad	dang. it still tries to install the rsa_key every time..
2014-05-13 13:55:31	hypnotoad	jazoff: any ideas on the install_rsa_key thing?
2014-05-13 14:03:20	jazoff	can you use unless for that too?
2014-05-13 14:03:55	hypnotoad	the problem is they both only install the one gpg-pubkey package
2014-05-13 14:04:19	hypnotoad	so the second key would never get intsalled
2014-05-13 14:05:14	jazoff	that seems odd.. not hard to fix though
2014-05-13 14:06:37	hypnotoad	wait maybe not..
2014-05-13 14:06:56	jazoff	yeah, i'd epxect them to be different
2014-05-13 14:07:11	hypnotoad	i did too but i somehow messed it up...i think this will work
2014-05-13 14:07:50	hypnotoad	still not sure why the other way failed, but this is cleaner anyways
2014-05-13 14:08:16	jazoff	rsa is gpg-pubkey-66fd4949-4803fe57
2014-05-13 14:08:26	jazoff	dsa is gpg-pubkey-04bbaa7b-4c881cbf
2014-05-13 14:08:41	hypnotoad	yup figured that out
2014-05-13 14:08:41	hypnotoad	givingi it a shot
2014-05-13 14:09:15	hypnotoad	thats the one.
2014-05-13 14:09:33	hypnotoad	woah...big heartbleed dump in /var/log/messages right after that...
2014-05-13 14:10:18	jazoff	oh, you on tornado? :)
2014-05-13 14:10:32	hypnotoad	hah ya

2014-05-19 11:29:12	jazoff	you're missing a }
2014-05-19 11:29:23	jazoff	the apache vhost is not closed
2014-05-19 11:30:12	soehlert	ugh i fixed that right AFTER i pushed it. and forgot to push...
2014-05-19 11:30:35	soehlert	so i was going crazy looking at the fixed one :)
2014-05-19 12:24:05	soehlert	jazoff: you think I could pass on the moin stuff to you? it seems to work (installs moin/fw/httpd is running and all that). not sure how configuration or anything else works from here on though.
2014-05-19 12:26:44	jazoff	hmm
2014-05-19 12:26:49	jazoff	I last set it up ages ago :)
2014-05-19 12:27:01	jazoff	I think one just edits the config.py or whatever and changes some values

2014-05-19 14:41:02	wraquel	This isn't the OrbitDownloaderSetup.exe guy is it?
2014-05-19 14:55:19	jazoff	well the original download was PowerISO5-x64.exe

2014-05-28 13:35:21	soehlert	can someone take a peek at the kickstart module. getting this error: "Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Syntax error at ','; expected '}' at /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/development/modules/kickstart/manifests/init.pp:27 on node kickstart-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu'
2014-05-28 15:25:13	jazoff	sure
2014-05-28 15:25:38	jazoff	you need []'s
2014-05-28 15:26:12	jazoff	also, do you mean /tftpboot/linux-install/${os}-${version}/pxelinux.cfg
2014-05-28 15:27:21	jazoff	ah, that was from a whiel ago
2014-05-28 15:27:22	jazoff	sigh
2014-05-29 11:04:02	soehlert	jazoff: good call on the array...too obvious sigh and good catch on the pxelinux.cfg
2014-05-29 14:56:32	soehlert	ok more puppet help. not sure why my variables are not being passed to the template in my kickstart module
2014-05-29 14:56:32	soehlert	im comparing it to how you do it in ntp jazoff, and it looks mostly the same. the only difference is i have empty string defaults and i'm trying to use two variables in one <%>
2014-05-29 15:32:21	jazoff	ah, that's a nono
2014-05-29 15:33:31	jazoff	try <%= @os %>-<%= @version %>
2014-05-29 15:34:11	jazoff	<%= @os + "-" + @version %> might work too
2014-05-29 15:36:59	jazoff	but the first would be good
2014-05-30 15:33:06	soehlert	anyone ever seen an error like this before? Invalid relationship: File[/etc/xinetd.d/tftp] { notify => Service[xinted] }, because Service[xinted] doesn't seem to be in the catalog
2014-05-30 15:39:10	soehlert	daaamn typo.
2014-05-30 15:41:46	wraquel	you mean xinted?
2014-05-30 15:41:52	wraquel	:D
2014-05-30 15:42:09	wraquel	You need a rubber ducky.
2014-05-30 15:42:19	wraquel	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
2014-05-30 15:42:59	soehlert	haha ya ive thought about that
2014-05-30 15:42:59	soehlert	almost all my fixes take me forever to figure out...right until i ask for help
2014-06-03 11:45:36	soehlert	trying to think how best to deal with tcpwrappers module. kickstart needs a slightly edited one. most everyone gets the same thing. should i template it with if statements? i cant pass out a default and then overwrite that in specific modules can i?
2014-06-03 11:50:26	jazoff	can you just do two different files?
2014-06-03 11:50:42	jazoff	you can do something like this:
2014-06-03 11:50:43	soehlert	what do you mean?
2014-06-03 11:50:43	jazoff	  file { "/usr/local/bro-$version/etc/node.cfg":
2014-06-03 11:50:43	jazoff	    source => [
2014-06-03 11:50:43	jazoff	      "puppet:///modules/bro/node.cfg.$hostname",
2014-06-03 11:50:43	jazoff	      "puppet:///modules/bro/node.cfg",
2014-06-03 11:50:45	jazoff	    ],
2014-06-03 11:50:53	jazoff	puppet will use the first source the matches
2014-06-03 11:51:18	jazoff	or possibly use hiera to switch out the source
2014-06-03 11:51:38	soehlert	so then basically every host that needs a specialized one gets a .hostname one and everyone else gets the other?
2014-06-03 11:51:45	jazoff	yep
2014-06-03 11:51:47	soehlert	"switch out the source"?
2014-06-03 11:51:54	jazoff	using a variable from hiera
2014-06-03 11:51:59	jazoff	but just doing .$hostname is really easy
2014-06-03 11:52:06	soehlert	ah i see
2014-06-03 12:24:03	soehlert	jazoff: I just realized i havent needed a kerberos token in a few days. puppet is getting there..
2014-06-03 12:33:15	jazoff	oh, you mean nto having to log into machines?
2014-06-03 12:34:03	soehlert	ya
2014-06-03 12:35:08	jazoff	cool :)

2014-06-12 14:17:40	soehlert	jazoff keist: im having issues getting the new kickstart server into puppet. scenario as follows:
2014-06-12 14:18:49	soehlert	puppetized kickstart, but finished before I knew we were going to centos. So I have to recreate that machine with centos using that machine. i puppet clean cert kickstart-sec on squall after kickstarting a new centos host. then i named that new host kickstart-sec, turned off the old one, and tried to install puppet agent
2014-06-12 14:19:03	soehlert	agent install script seemingly works, but the WUI shows 0 node requests
2014-06-12 14:19:13	soehlert	i see the traffic coming into squall via tcpdump.
2014-06-12 14:43:48	jazoff	hmm
2014-06-12 14:48:10	jazoff	can you sudo pkill -USR1 puppet
2014-06-12 14:48:25	soehlert	on the new kickstart machine?
2014-06-12 14:48:35	jazoff	yeah
2014-06-12 14:49:20	soehlert	well ya, but it doesn't help
2014-06-12 14:49:20	soehlert	ive tried uninstalling puppet and doing it over and still nothing
2014-06-12 14:49:39	soehlert	im thinking something is wrong with the cert process
2014-06-12 14:50:00	soehlert	i'm seeing puppet-agent errors in messages talking about key values mismatch
2014-06-12 14:50:00	soehlert	but squall doesn't have a cert so idk
2014-06-12 14:50:06	soehlert	cert for kickstart-sec that is
2014-06-12 14:51:17	jazoff	hmm
2014-06-12 14:51:33	jazoff	can yo stop puppet agent on the box and do the 
2014-06-12 14:51:38	jazoff	puppet agent --debug
2014-06-12 14:51:40	jazoff	i think it is
2014-06-12 14:52:29	jazoff	puppet agent --onetime --debug maybe
2014-06-12 14:53:18	soehlert	no errors
2014-06-12 14:53:23	jazoff	but what did it say?
2014-06-12 14:53:24	soehlert	still no node request
2014-06-12 14:53:44	soehlert	just autrequiring a TON of files
2014-06-12 14:53:55	soehlert	private_keys certs and state files
2014-06-12 14:53:59	jazoff	what's the ip of this box?
2014-06-12 14:54:17	soehlert	currently its still on its dhcpd ip of 10.142.148.95
2014-06-12 14:54:34	soehlert	i wonder if that's an issue...that hostname exists so maybe puppet is reversing it and its failing?
2014-06-12 14:54:44	jazoff	could be
2014-06-12 14:55:21	soehlert	i'll try that
2014-06-12 15:14:26	soehlert	nope
2014-06-12 15:19:45	jazoff	does secops exist on it?
2014-06-12 15:51:17	wraquel	is ncsabot alive?
2014-06-12 15:51:25	wraquel	aaaaand wrong channel
2014-06-12 16:05:40	soehlert	any other ideas for the kickstart-sec issues?
2014-06-12 16:09:17	soehlert	aha i got it. used kickstart-sec for the cert name instead of the fqdn
2014-06-12 16:43:28	jazoff	ah
2014-06-12 16:43:41	jazoff	I was going to see about diffing the agent output from that box and from a working one

2014-07-16 12:56:41	soehlert	jazoff: puppet is so different it looks like uninstalling puppet and then reinstalling on the clients is going to be the best way to handle it
2014-07-16 12:57:08	soehlert	puppet now includes its own repo for pe packages so thats nice. one curl command piped to bash and its installed
2014-07-16 12:57:30	soehlert	in other news, stll not sure how to get the autopull stuff on puppet-sec. i cant puppetize it from squall.
2014-07-16 12:59:47	jazoff	well we need to first ensure that the directory structure is the same
2014-07-16 12:59:53	soehlert	i did that
2014-07-16 12:59:59	jazoff	and if so, just adding the autopull module to puppet-sec should do it
2014-07-16 13:00:13	jazoff	or just look at what that module does, it's just a file copy or two 
2014-07-16 13:00:19	soehlert	but what i mean is the modules dont exist on puppet-sec
2014-07-16 13:00:26	jazoff	oh
2014-07-16 13:00:31	jazoff	so you need to checkout all the git repos
2014-07-16 13:01:19	soehlert	ah ok
2014-07-16 13:38:26	soehlert	how do i checkout the configs branch without screwing things up? 
2014-07-16 13:49:33	jazoff	git checkout configs
2014-07-16 13:49:34	jazoff	that work?
2014-07-16 13:49:49	soehlert	well i just am concerned about overwriting the whole configs directory
2014-07-16 13:50:01	jazoff	overwrting what directory?
2014-07-16 13:50:12	soehlert	/etc/puppetlabs/puppet
2014-07-16 13:50:36	soehlert	though i guess it'll only do individual files no thte whole directory right?
2014-07-16 13:51:22	jazoff	clone it to /etc/puppetlabs/puppet_from_git
2014-07-16 13:51:29	jazoff	then see what if anything is different in puppet
2014-07-16 13:51:35	soehlert	ah good idea
2014-07-16 13:51:36	jazoff	then mv puppet puppet.orig; mv puppet_from_git puppet
2014-07-16 13:51:54	soehlert	well its not all the files i dont think so that wont quite work, but i can do that with individual files
2014-07-16 13:52:56	soehlert	actually the git repo won't be initialized in the right spot then will it?
2014-07-16 13:53:16	jazoff	doesn't matter.. there's nothing in the git dir that says where it is
2014-07-16 13:53:44	soehlert	but i mean if i initialize it to puppet_from_git, then move those files into /etc/puppetlabs/puppet, they'll be outside of the repo
2014-07-16 13:54:44	jazoff	don't move the files, make puppet_from_git the puppet dir
2014-07-16 13:54:51	jazoff	anything missing move it from the puppet dir
2014-07-16 13:55:08	soehlert	but puppet relies on that directory structure so i cant do that
2014-07-16 13:55:15	jazoff	stop puppet
2014-07-16 13:55:50	soehlert	how does that help? when i start it up the files still wont be where puppet expects. 
2014-07-16 13:56:53	jazoff	they will, because you will put them there
2014-07-16 13:57:16	jazoff	you're just thinking about it backwards
2014-07-16 13:57:29	jazoff	don't move what is in git to puppet/ make git the puppet/ and move anything that was missing back in there
2014-07-16 13:58:45	soehlert	so stop puppet. mv puppet{,.old}, git clone to puppet. copy individual files from puppet.old to puppet as needed?
2014-07-16 13:58:53	jazoff	yep
2014-07-16 13:59:11	soehlert	ok
2014-07-16 13:59:21	jazoff	did you copy over the .ssh key from the old server?
2014-07-16 13:59:25	jazoff	since that is in gitlab as a deploy key
2014-07-16 13:59:28	soehlert	ya
2014-07-16 14:01:22	jazoff	crap, forgot to eat
2014-07-16 14:01:26	jazoff	late lunchtime :)
2014-07-16 14:18:45	soehlert	looks like someone pushed weird xcode stuff into puppet configs
2014-07-16 14:18:45	 *	soehlert hopes it wasn't me
2014-07-16 14:19:03	 *	soehlert is very disappointed..
2014-07-16 14:27:55	soehlert	ok i think everything is as it's supposed to be now.
2014-07-16 14:33:48	soehlert	arghhh it says pe-httpd can't start because the pem file isn't there or empty and both of those are false
2014-07-16 14:36:50	jazoff	permnissions?
2014-07-16 14:37:11	jazoff	yeah.. I just noticed the xcode thing like 20 minutes ago and deleted it
2014-07-16 14:37:33	jazoff	apparently it was you :)
2014-07-16 14:42:56	soehlert	indeed it was. do i need to add the autopull to site.pp? or just a hiera file somewhere?
2014-07-16 14:44:44	jazoff	hieradata/production/secapps/puppetmaster.yaml:    - puppetstuff::autopull
2014-07-16 14:44:49	jazoff	should be there
2014-07-16 14:45:00	soehlert	i never realized we had a puppetmaster file ugh alright.
2014-07-16 14:45:17	soehlert	in other news were going to have problems because Connection Error: No classes found on the puppet master. 
2014-07-16 14:45:29	jazoff	ah
2014-07-16 14:45:38	jazoff	puppet enterpise is so complicated 
2014-07-16 14:45:38	soehlert	not sure how to deal with that.
2014-07-16 14:45:45	soehlert	details "There was an error performing resource type search: 500 "Internal Server Error" "
2014-07-16 14:46:21	jazoff	check puppet logs
2014-07-16 14:46:27	soehlert	yup
2014-07-16 15:24:52	jazoff	doh, i removed the xcode stuff but didnt push
2014-07-16 15:24:56	jazoff	which explains why you still saw it
2014-07-17 10:55:22	soehlert	so it would seem that this is the error causing us to not have access to modules../var/log/pe-httpd/error.log:App 26923 stderr: CertAPI::ApiFailureException - Error retrieving certificates from puppet API (it returned a 500 error):
2014-07-17 10:55:28	soehlert	not sure how to fix it though. ideas?

2014-07-17 11:20:53	jazoff	https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-545
2014-07-17 11:21:06	soehlert	hah i just found that link to
2014-07-17 11:21:09	jazoff	see /var/log/messages, it is telling you to change some things
2014-07-17 11:25:00	soehlert	ahh crap
2014-07-17 11:25:15	soehlert	git overwrote my puppet.conf so master thought it was squall
2014-07-17 12:26:37	soehlert	ughhh almost there. just gotta find out where this self signed cert from squall is at..
2014-07-17 12:29:01	jazoff	on squall...
2014-07-17 12:29:08	jazoff	probably
2014-07-17 12:29:15	jazoff	it's the client cert it is complaining about i bet
2014-07-17 12:29:34	soehlert	no puppet-sec is the one failing saying its trying to use a self signed cert from squall
2014-07-17 12:29:46	jazoff	oh
2014-07-17 12:47:29	jazoff	looks like it's almost working
2014-07-17 12:47:46	soehlert	yup once i get this ca thing i think it'll be all good
2014-07-17 13:41:08	soehlert	i could use some other brain power on this if anyones got some free time
2014-07-21 13:17:29	soehlert	hey jazoff can you give me some help with puppet-sec? i am just totally running out of ideas
2014-07-21 13:23:59	jazoff	sure
2014-07-21 13:24:37	jazoff	more cert issues?
2014-07-21 13:24:40	soehlert	ya
2014-07-21 13:24:46	soehlert	Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Failed to submit 'replace facts' command for puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu to PuppetDB at puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu:8081: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed: [unable to get local issuer certificate for /CN=puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu]
2014-07-21 13:24:55	jazoff	yeah.. i also see
2014-07-21 13:25:00	jazoff	Jul 21 13:24:13 puppet-sec puppet-agent[22717]: Could not back up /var/lib/peadmin/.mcollective.d/peadmin-cacert.pem: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed: [self signed certificate in certificate chain for /CN=Puppet CA generated on squall.ncsa.illinois.edu at 2013-10-28 12:59:06 -0500]
2014-07-21 13:25:12	jazoff	so there is some old certs still in there somewhere
2014-07-21 13:25:14	soehlert	ya that one seems to have been taken over by this one
2014-07-21 13:25:26	soehlert	wait you see that one recently. weird..
2014-07-21 13:25:37	jazoff	yeah
2014-07-21 13:29:04	jazoff	where's it pulling that from?
2014-07-21 13:29:28	soehlert	all puppet ssl things are in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl
2014-07-21 13:37:46	jazoff	are there any new machines that are poitned at the new puppet server?
2014-07-21 13:38:03	soehlert	i had repo-sec, but now thats in a weird limbo state
2014-07-21 13:38:04	jazoff	ah, repo-sec?
2014-07-21 13:38:19	jazoff	it's hard to tell somethings when you are running locally
2014-07-21 13:38:25	jazoff	testing from repo-sec will make it more clear what is going on...
2014-07-21 13:38:46	soehlert	it was suggested i try to remove it and readd it to get the certs to sync up but it failed and now repo-sec is messed up as far as that goes
2014-07-21 14:02:16	jazoff	so if I do
2014-07-21 14:02:17	jazoff	[root@repo-sec ~]# openssl s_client  -CAfile /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem  -host puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu -port 8140
2014-07-21 14:02:27	jazoff	that says it is fine
2014-07-21 14:10:10	jazoff	well
2014-07-21 14:10:10	jazoff	https://ask.puppetlabs.com/question/1547/puppet-enterprise-inventory-ssl-error/
2014-07-21 14:10:15	jazoff	that didn't work either
2014-07-21 14:26:40	jazoff	ah, somewhat fixed it
2014-07-21 14:26:43	jazoff	 /sbin/service puppetdb restart
2014-07-21 14:26:44	jazoff	er
2014-07-21 14:26:47	jazoff	http://blogs.ubc.ca/compass/2013/06/12/failed-to-submit-replace-facts-to-puppetdb-certificate-verify-failed/
2014-07-21 14:26:51	jazoff	had to recreate the puppetdb certs
2014-07-21 14:28:48	jazoff	was funny because I was thinking to myself
2014-07-21 14:28:54	jazoff	I've never had ANY of these problems when using just puppet
2014-07-21 14:28:58	jazoff	just puppet does not include puppetdb :)
2014-07-21 14:29:22	jazoff	ok, so now the only error I am getting is the
2014-07-21 14:29:27	jazoff	Error: Could not back up /etc/puppetlabs/mcollective/ssl/clients/puppet-dashboard-public.pem: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed: [self signed certificate in certificate chain for /CN=Puppet CA generated on squall.ncsa.illinois.edu at 2013-10-28 12:59
2014-07-21 14:30:32	jazoff	moving /etc/puppetlabs/mcollective/ssl to ssl.old seems to have fixed that
2014-07-21 14:31:38	jazoff	just getting some regular puppet errors now
2014-07-21 14:31:45	jazoff	seems /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/ does not exist by default
2014-07-21 14:34:32	jazoff	oh, still getting a
2014-07-21 14:34:33	jazoff	Error: Could not back up /usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed: [self signed certificate in certificate chain for /CN=Puppet CA generated on squall.ncsa.illinois.edu at 2013-10-28 12:59:06 -0500]
2014-07-21 14:35:43	soehlert	ya that's back where iw as last week with this :)
2014-07-21 14:35:43	soehlert	ive tried the stuff on the two links you sent (i actually had already been to those exact links)
2014-07-21 14:36:54	jazoff	so where the hell is the squall still coming from
2014-07-21 14:37:23	jazoff	ah.. ok, brute force..
2014-07-21 14:37:49	jazoff	oh, found it in an .old dir
2014-07-21 14:37:50	jazoff	grrr
2014-07-21 14:38:09	soehlert	why is puppet still using the .old dir?
2014-07-21 14:38:21	jazoff	i don't think it is
2014-07-21 14:38:27	jazoff	but that was the only place I found a squall cert
2014-07-21 14:38:42	soehlert	ah ya. i already looked through all of the ssl/ dir for squall anything
2014-07-21 14:39:04	jazoff	i ran
2014-07-21 14:39:04	jazoff	find /etc/puppetlabs/ -type f|grep -i ssl | while read f;do echo $f;openssl x509 -in $f -text 2>/dev/null | grep squall ;done|less
2014-07-21 14:39:21	soehlert	thats basically what i did too
2014-07-21 14:41:41	jazoff	so i grabbed a pcap
2014-07-21 14:42:43	jazoff	and the ssl log definitely contains a 141.142.148.26141.142.148.178140squall.ncsa.illinois.edu-
2014-07-21 14:42:55	jazoff	but initially it IS puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu
2014-07-21 14:43:00	soehlert	ughhh weird
2014-07-21 14:43:06	jazoff	ooh wow
2014-07-21 14:43:08	jazoff	look at the IP
2014-07-21 14:43:12	jazoff	it's the fileserver conf I bet
2014-07-21 14:43:36	soehlert	holy crap. what the hell is that IP{
2014-07-21 14:43:49	soehlert	filserver.conf is empty
2014-07-21 14:43:58	jazoff	squall
2014-07-21 14:44:00	jazoff	hmm
2014-07-21 14:44:04	jazoff	something is telling it to use squall
2014-07-21 14:44:18	jazoff	oooooh
2014-07-21 14:44:18	jazoff	manifests/site.pp:  server => 'squall.ncsa.illinois.edu',

2014-07-21 14:44:28	jazoff	}
2014-07-21 14:44:34	jazoff	...
2014-07-21 14:44:34	soehlert	ahhhh damn
2014-07-21 14:44:44	jazoff	why is that there? :)
2014-07-21 14:45:11	soehlert	i have no idea
2014-07-21 14:45:14	soehlert	i dont even know what that is
2014-07-21 14:45:23	soehlert	i mean why it exists there instead of the filebucket
2014-07-21 14:45:46	soehlert	wait that file doesnt exist
2014-07-21 14:46:27	jazoff	/etc/puppetlabs//puppet/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
2014-07-21 14:46:39	soehlert	ahh in environment
2014-07-21 14:47:41	soehlert	ok updated

2014-07-21 14:48:24	soehlert	damn
2014-07-21 14:48:41	jazoff	where did you change that?
2014-07-21 14:49:04	soehlert	in the git repo for that file. 
2014-07-21 14:49:10	soehlert	wait its not autopulling yet...
2014-07-21 14:49:18	jazoff	:)
2014-07-21 14:50:43	soehlert	ahh still failing
2014-07-21 14:51:38	jazoff	where did you change it now?
2014-07-21 14:51:46	jazoff	./development/manifests/site.pp:  server => 'squall.ncsa.illinois.edu',
2014-07-21 14:51:51	jazoff	it's still there
2014-07-21 14:51:54	soehlert	ahh only production
2014-07-21 14:54:15	jazoff	better?
2014-07-21 14:54:33	soehlert	MUUUCH
2014-07-21 14:54:41	jazoff	:)
2014-07-21 14:54:42	soehlert	thank you very much this was driving me up a wall
2014-07-21 14:54:47	jazoff	me too :)
2014-07-21 14:54:54	jazoff	I should have resorted to pcap earlier
2014-07-21 14:55:06	soehlert	it never even ocurred to me whoops
2014-07-21 14:55:09	jazoff	there WAS nothign wrong with the certs, it was just actually hitting squall
2014-07-21 14:55:22	jazoff	i was mostly trying to figure out which service/port/whatever had the problem and when
2014-07-21 14:56:04	soehlert	sweet and now it works on puppet-sec too so autopull should be working i think
2014-07-21 15:02:50	jazoff	ok, walk time
2014-07-21 15:23:21	soehlert	hmmm new problem...can't get to the dashboard
2014-07-21 15:26:21	jazoff	oh?
2014-07-21 15:26:29	soehlert	 (Error code: sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial)
2014-07-21 15:26:38	jazoff	oh, you need to delete teh exception in FF
2014-07-21 15:27:00	soehlert	ah right. i was assuming it was server side thing doh
2014-07-22 10:33:08	jazoff	so puppet all better?
2014-07-22 10:33:55	soehlert	yes except i just realized autopull isn't working as i have to set the role::profile still
2014-07-22 10:33:55	soehlert	only problem is removing the exception still didnt work. can you get to the dashboard?
2014-07-22 10:36:16	jazoff	yeah
2014-07-22 10:36:23	jazoff	are you still getting the reused serial error or whatever it is?
2014-07-22 10:45:41	soehlert	ya
2014-07-22 10:45:52	soehlert	but at least i know for sure its on my end now
2014-07-22 10:50:31	soehlert	well thats weird. its working today..ughhhh
2014-07-22 10:56:15	soehlert	apparently we had a puppetmaster and puppet-manager profile though. so i had to deal with that, but autopull now should be working
2014-07-22 11:02:24	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec ~]# status autopull
2014-07-22 11:02:25	jazoff	autopull stop/waiting
2014-07-22 11:02:25	jazoff	hmm
2014-07-22 11:02:52	jazoff	well, starting it worked
2014-07-22 11:02:55	jazoff	nto sure why puppet didnt start it
2014-07-22 11:03:09	jazoff	oh, because the module doesnt tell it to
2014-07-22 11:03:11	jazoff	i'll fix
2014-07-22 11:03:16	soehlert	ya i was just gonna say
2014-07-22 11:06:22	jazoff	oh, git-sec needs to be updated to point to the new puppet server
2014-07-22 11:06:53	soehlert	?
2014-07-22 11:07:08	soehlert	as in the puppet agent? because they all need that except repo-sec
2014-07-22 11:07:12	jazoff	that's how autopull works
2014-07-22 11:07:19	jazoff	it's a webhook from git-sec
2014-07-22 11:07:25	soehlert	oooo so yes, but it's more important for git-sec
2014-07-22 11:07:32	jazoff	also realize the firewall rule isn't there.. not sure how that was working before
2014-07-22 11:08:31	soehlert	just so everyone has it...here's the command to add an agent: curl -k https://puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash
2014-07-22 11:08:41	soehlert	but ill go do git-sec now
2014-07-22 11:08:57	jazoff	it's not a puppet thing, it's in the web interface
2014-07-22 11:09:07	soehlert	oooo misunderstood.
2014-07-22 11:09:21	soehlert	so where's that changed?
2014-07-22 11:09:34	jazoff	webhook settings for the repo
2014-07-22 11:09:41	soehlert	is that in puppet?
2014-07-22 11:10:00	jazoff	no, it's in the git-sec web interface
2014-07-22 11:10:09	soehlert	ahh
2014-07-22 11:14:47	jazoff	squall is broken right?
2014-07-22 11:14:53	soehlert	ya why?
2014-07-22 11:14:54	jazoff	so I should just change it and not add puppet-sec?
2014-07-22 11:15:05	soehlert	ya we're done with squall. 
2014-07-22 11:18:40	jazoff	ok, i think i got the webhook setup
2014-07-22 11:18:54	soehlert	sweet
2014-07-23 11:02:58	keist	hmmm, am I forgetting something? I created a new module called netsniff_ng, created a yaml file in services/mousetooth.yaml that includes the netsniff_ng class, and then set role::profile in the WUI for mousetooth. Am getting:
2014-07-23 11:03:02	keist	Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Could not find class netsniff_ng for mousetooth.ncsa.illinois.edu on node mousetooth.ncsa.illinois.edu
2014-07-23 11:03:05	keist	Warning: Not using cache on failed catalog
2014-07-23 11:03:07	keist	Error: Could not retrieve catalog; skipping run
2014-07-23 11:03:30	keist	so it knows to load the netsniff_ng class but can't find it :/
2014-07-23 11:03:53	jazoff	what does /etc/motd contain?
2014-07-23 11:10:35	keist	aha! that's it, looks like it had it right on my second run but changed :/
2014-07-23 11:10:38	keist	 This is a development server with:
2014-07-23 11:10:38	keist	-    * role services_scanner
2014-07-23 11:10:38	keist	-    * profile mousetooth-server
2014-07-23 11:10:38	keist	+    * role
2014-07-23 11:10:39	keist	+    * profile
2014-07-23 11:11:02	jazoff	oh, yes, it takes two runs
2014-07-23 11:11:10	jazoff	the first run will deploy the role::profile fact
2014-07-23 11:11:19	jazoff	and then the second run it will use it
2014-07-23 11:11:34	jazoff	it's kinda complicated
2014-07-23 11:13:15	keist	do you know if I can accept a certificate on the puppet server from the command-line? web interface is broken atm and I need to add a host
2014-07-23 11:13:21	jazoff	yes
2014-07-23 11:13:22	jazoff	puppet ca list
2014-07-23 11:13:25	jazoff	puppet ca sign ...
2014-07-23 11:13:33	keist	kk, thx
2014-07-23 11:14:38	keist	one last question for now, can you assign the environment and role:profile from the cmd-line?
2014-07-23 11:15:00	jazoff	dunno about that one
2014-07-23 11:15:18	keist	kk, will look it up
2014-07-23 11:45:59	soehlert	nope you cant
2014-07-23 12:01:02	jazoff	that's one of the reasons I kinda like plain puppet better
2014-07-23 12:01:12	jazoff	everything is files and you can keep everything in git
2014-07-23 12:04:54	soehlert	i should say we might be able to, but then we'll end up mixing and matching and it'll get pretty ugly
2014-07-23 12:08:08	jazoff	yeah
2014-07-23 12:51:20	keist	eyrich added a few rule so puppet-sec and git-sec can communicate (pull should be working again)
2014-07-23 12:55:21	jazoff	again? I thought it was already working
2014-07-23 12:55:23	jazoff	seemed to be yesterday
2014-07-23 12:57:13	keist	sam removed an interface yesterday
2014-07-23 12:57:21	keist	err, today
2014-07-23 12:57:30	keist	so another change :) working now 
2014-07-23 12:58:49	jazoff	ohh
2014-07-23 12:59:06	jazoff	i think that was the ip i pointed the webhook to
2014-07-23 12:59:07	soehlert	two interfaces made adding internal only hosts fail
2014-07-23 13:00:21	jazoff	ok, fixed
2014-07-23 13:00:35	jazoff	pointed it to just http://puppet-sec:9000 which should work
2014-07-23 13:00:57	soehlert	probably not. puppet-sec.internal.ncsa.edu is registered
2014-07-23 13:01:04	soehlert	so internal hosts (like git-sec) will use that
2014-07-23 13:01:50	jazoff	probably not?
2014-07-23 13:02:09	jazoff	oh, i see
2014-07-23 13:02:10	jazoff	grr
2014-07-23 13:02:10	soehlert	which should just work...i could see that failing
2014-07-23 13:03:12	jazoff	ok, changed to http://puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu:9000
2014-07-23 13:03:27	jazoff	which seems to fail
2014-07-23 13:03:47	jazoff	oh, somehow I copied the text of the button
2014-07-23 13:03:48	jazoff	grr
2014-07-23 13:03:49	soehlert	why port 9000?
2014-07-23 13:04:04	jazoff	because that's the port I used
2014-07-23 13:04:07	soehlert	ah ok
2014-07-23 13:04:19	soehlert	just making sure you didnt mix up a puppet port
2014-07-23 13:04:34	jazoff	seems to work
2014-07-23 13:04:50	soehlert	cool
2014-07-23 13:07:18	jazoff	http://gizmodo.com/this-box-can-hold-an-entire-netflix-1592590450
2014-07-23 13:09:33	soehlert	we should probably get one in the office
2014-07-23 16:20:04	keist	:)
2014-07-29 10:37:27	soehlert	hey just noticed this: "Puppet Enterprise is now using a new ordering setting in the Puppet core that allows you to configure how unrelated resources should be ordered when applying a catalog."
2014-07-29 10:37:31	soehlert	kinda cool
2014-07-29 12:03:02	jazoff	oh? is that like the stages?
2014-07-29 12:03:08	jazoff	i had tried to get those to work but always got errors
2014-07-29 12:34:44	soehlert	ya i think so. "Regardless of this setting’s value, Puppet will always obey explicit dependencies set with the before/require/notify/subscribe metaparameters and the ->/~> chaining arrows; this setting only affects the relative ordering of unrelated resources."
2014-07-29 14:06:43	<--	keist (jschipp@hidden-E95C13A8.ncsa.illinois.edu) has quit (Ping timeout)
2014-07-29 14:58:38	soehlert	fuuuuuuuuuck. more ssl errors now that git-sec has changed
2014-07-29 15:09:42	jazoff	oh?
2014-07-29 15:09:45	jazoff	where?
2014-07-29 15:09:54	jazoff	oh, you mean firefox?
2014-07-29 15:10:06	soehlert	no as in if you do a puppet run on a host it fails
2014-07-29 15:10:10	jazoff	oooh
2014-07-29 15:10:13	jazoff	oooh, that's easy
2014-07-29 15:10:40	soehlert	?
2014-07-29 15:10:58	jazoff	try puppet node clean git-sec...
2014-07-29 15:11:18	jazoff	then you should have to resign it with puppet ca sign
2014-07-29 15:30:22	soehlert	i cant resign it as a request doesnt exist
2014-07-29 15:30:22	soehlert	not sure how to make a new one..
2014-07-29 15:36:20	jazoff	oh, just run puppet on the box
2014-07-29 15:37:04	soehlert	on which box?
2014-07-29 15:37:04	soehlert	tried on both and it fails for different ssl reasons on each
2014-07-29 15:37:25	jazoff	on git sec
2014-07-29 15:37:35	soehlert	ya that doesn't work at all
2014-07-29 15:37:51	jazoff	that will request the cert
2014-07-29 15:37:58	soehlert	but it cant complete a run
2014-07-29 15:38:06	soehlert	and puppet-sec doesnt see a request
2014-07-29 15:38:14	jazoff	oh?
2014-07-29 15:38:16	jazoff	lemme see
2014-07-29 15:38:50	soehlert	getting the self signed cert error when i try to run on git-sec. didnt you fix that by removing the ssl dir? really dont wanna dot hat..
2014-07-29 15:40:34	jazoff	depends which error...
2014-07-29 15:40:49	soehlert	self signed certificate in certificate chain for /CN=Puppet CA generated on puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu at 2014-07-16 12:12:57 -0500
2014-07-29 15:43:43	jazoff	yeah, that's to be expected if it's using the wrong one
2014-07-29 15:45:49	jazoff	mostly fixedf
2014-07-29 15:46:05	soehlert	whatd you do?
2014-07-29 15:46:18	jazoff	moved the ssl dir out of the way on git-sec
2014-07-29 15:46:21	jazoff	and then cleaned+signed
2014-07-29 15:47:05	jazoff	still getting Jul 29 15:46:49 git-sec puppet-agent[14149]: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Failed to submit 'replace facts' command for git-sec.internal.ncsa.edu to PuppetDB at puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu:8081: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed: [unable to get local issuer certificate for /CN=puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu]
2014-07-29 15:47:42	soehlert	ya thats the one that puppet-sec gets too. 
2014-07-29 15:47:42	soehlert	seemingly on the master side?
2014-07-29 15:48:37	jazoff	yeah.. somethign with puppetdb again
2014-07-29 15:49:01	jazoff	thought I fixed that though
2014-07-29 15:50:54	soehlert	you had at one point.
2014-07-29 15:56:00	jazoff	so if I do 
2014-07-29 15:56:01	jazoff	openssl s_client -host `hostname -f` -port 8081 -CAfile /etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/ssl/ca.pem
2014-07-29 15:56:03	jazoff	it is fine
2014-07-29 15:57:05	soehlert	ya i just did that same exact thing hah
2014-07-29 15:59:06	soehlert	ahhh try this
2014-07-29 15:59:13	soehlert	openssl s_client -host `hostname -f` -port 8081 -CAfile /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem

2014-07-29 16:00:04	jazoff	yeah... is it supposed to be the same cert?
2014-07-29 16:00:12	soehlert	i'm not sure. 
2014-07-29 16:00:19	jazoff	or is one supposed to have signed the other
2014-07-29 16:00:25	jazoff	well, we can try regenerating the puppetdb cert
2014-07-29 16:00:27	jazoff	is easy enough

2014-07-29 16:03:23	jazoff	better?
2014-07-29 16:03:24	jazoff	i think
2014-07-29 16:03:37	jazoff	Warning: Error 400 on SERVER: Could not find terminus console for indirection node
2014-07-29 16:03:39	jazoff	uh?
2014-07-29 16:04:46	jazoff	that might be an issue with the puppet conf
2014-07-29 16:04:54	soehlert	ya looking at that now
2014-07-29 16:06:58	jazoff	we moved over the old puppet.conf file right?
2014-07-29 16:07:10	soehlert	ya
2014-07-29 16:08:18	jazoff	cause we have this
2014-07-29 16:08:19	jazoff	    node_terminus = console
2014-07-29 16:08:35	soehlert	that seemingly is what we need..
2014-07-29 16:08:41	jazoff	or maybe don't need?
2014-07-29 16:08:55	soehlert	well google suggests we need to verify we have that set like it is
2014-07-29 16:09:07	soehlert	https://ask.puppetlabs.com/question/13024/pe-33-on-rhel-7-could-not-find-terminus-console-for-indirection-node/
2014-07-29 16:10:09	jazoff	hmm
2014-07-29 16:10:13	jazoff	it doesn't say what section that should be in
2014-07-29 16:10:42	soehlert	that was already in there by default. i didnt add it fwiw
2014-07-29 16:11:03	jazoff	hmm
2014-07-29 16:22:00	jazoff	so the errro is from
2014-07-29 16:22:01	jazoff	    unless Puppet::Indirector::Terminus.terminus_class(self.name, terminus_class)
2014-07-29 16:22:03	jazoff	      raise ArgumentError, "Could not find terminus #{terminus_class} for indirection #{self.name}"
2014-07-29 16:22:28	jazoff	or
2014-07-29 16:22:28	jazoff	    unless klass = Puppet::Indirector::Terminus.terminus_class(self.name, terminus_class)
2014-07-29 16:22:30	soehlert	what file is that?
2014-07-29 16:22:30	jazoff	      raise ArgumentError, "Could not find terminus #{terminus_class} for indirection #{self.name}"
2014-07-29 16:22:33	jazoff	which I guess is the same
2014-07-29 16:22:38	soehlert	and surriously...klass? hahah
2014-07-29 16:22:44	jazoff	./lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/puppet/indirector/indirection.rb
2014-07-29 16:22:50	jazoff	yeah, that comes up often since class is a resrved word
2014-07-29 16:24:06	soehlert	ah gotcha
2014-07-29 16:24:39	jazoff	and in theory this is what it is lookign for
2014-07-29 16:24:40	jazoff	./share/puppet/modules/puppet_enterprise/lib/puppet/indirector/node/console.rb
2014-07-29 16:25:04	soehlert	ya i took a look at that file. and it exists. dunno if theres something in specific it's supposed to be passing along or something
2014-07-29 16:25:19	jazoff	yeah, puppet errors are pretty much useless
2014-07-29 16:25:28	soehlert	im noticing
2014-07-29 16:27:39	soehlert	i gotta run. gotta be somewhere by 5.
2014-07-29 16:27:45	jazoff	though, it is the only file in that dir
2014-07-29 16:27:56	jazoff	all the other oens are in lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/puppet/indirector/node/
2014-07-29 16:28:33	jazoff	ah, cause that is regular stuff, the enterprise stuff is split out
2014-07-29 16:32:50	jazoff	might be a question for puppet support 
2014-07-29 16:32:51	jazoff	https://ask.puppetlabs.com/question/13024/pe-33-on-rhel-7-could-not-find-terminus-console-for-indirection-node/
2014-07-29 16:32:59	jazoff	oh, yeah, you had that link too
2014-07-29 16:35:13	jazoff	it's like it's not loading /opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules/puppet_enterprise/lib/
2014-07-29 16:36:32	jazoff	hmmm
2014-07-29 16:37:18	jazoff	the erb template the installer uses has
2014-07-29 16:37:19	jazoff	    modulepath = /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
2014-07-29 16:37:25	jazoff	we have     basemodulepath = /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
2014-07-29 16:38:07	jazoff	so I think I see how to fix
2014-07-29 16:38:13	jazoff	oh, we have basemodulepath and then later
2014-07-29 16:38:17	jazoff	modulepath = $confdir/environments/ncsa_production/modules
2014-07-29 16:38:23	jazoff	but I wonder if it doesn't use the base one 
2014-07-29 16:41:31	jazoff	yeah, the environments are the problem
2014-07-29 16:41:41	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec ~]# puppet config print modulepath --section master --environment production
2014-07-29 16:41:45	jazoff	Warning: Sections other than main, master, agent, user are deprecated in puppet.conf. Please use the directory environments feature to specify environments. (See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments.html)
2014-07-29 16:41:49	jazoff	   (at /opt/puppet/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/puppet/settings/config_file.rb:77:in `collect')
2014-07-29 16:41:52	jazoff	/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules
2014-07-29 16:49:43	jazoff	so I think the fix is to just add +    environmentpath = $confdir/environments
2014-07-29 16:49:49	jazoff	and comment out the environments at the end
2014-07-29 16:49:59	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec puppet]# puppet config print modulepath --section master --environment production
2014-07-29 16:50:02	jazoff	/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
2014-07-29 16:51:04	jazoff	oh, that's what was there and you changed it?
2014-07-29 16:51:36	jazoff	well, if you undo it it seems to work
2014-07-29 16:52:34	jazoff	grrrr, now it is back to doing Jul 29 16:52:10 git-sec puppet-agent[17438]: Error 400 on SERVER: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server session ticket A: tlsv1 alert unknown ca
2014-07-29 17:00:01	jazoff	ah, error on server, hmm
2014-07-29 17:02:48	jazoff	grabbed a pcap and looked at it in bro...
2014-07-29 17:03:00	jazoff	looks like the error is from talking to localhost on 443
2014-07-29 17:03:05	jazoff	so, the console?
2014-07-29 17:06:00	jazoff	ok, re did this agian: https://ask.puppetlabs.com/question/1547/puppet-enterprise-inventory-ssl-error/
2014-07-29 17:06:03	jazoff	which I think fixed it
2014-07-29 17:06:30	jazoff	yay
2014-07-29 17:06:46	jazoff	so, I guess what complicates puppet enterprise is that there are 3 certs
2014-07-29 17:06:56	jazoff	puppet, puppetdb, puppet http console thing
2014-07-29 17:07:02	jazoff	where with regular puppet there is just puppet ca cert
2014-07-29 17:10:41	jazoff	ok, redid the cert on repo-sec too, that's working too
2014-07-30 09:37:06	soehlert	jazoff: thanks for fixing it. my only concern now is we were unable to get the dynamic environments working. it was just ignoring anything besides production. that's why i was trying to use the old style (which should still work, just throw a warning because they want people to start moving away from it)
2014-07-30 09:43:28	jazoff	oh
2014-07-30 09:43:30	jazoff	is it not working?
2014-07-30 09:45:08	soehlert	it wasn't as of yesterday before this all broke down
2014-07-30 09:48:18	jazoff	ah, well how does it look now? :)
2014-07-30 09:48:35	soehlert	one sec gotta get over to test it
2014-07-30 09:49:54	soehlert	doesnt work
2014-07-30 09:51:47	jazoff	ok, so back to http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments.html
2014-07-30 09:51:54	jazoff	what are we doing different than that?
2014-07-30 09:52:32	soehlert	we're not. trust me, jon and i spent hours pouring over the docs and all that already. i was going to try to make the old way work and if it didnt, go to support (who suck so i wanted to avoid that if possible)
2014-07-30 09:52:49	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec ~]# puppet config print modulepath --section master --environment production
2014-07-30 09:52:52	jazoff	/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
2014-07-30 09:52:56	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec ~]# puppet config print modulepath --section master --environment development
2014-07-30 09:52:59	jazoff	/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/development/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
2014-07-30 09:53:03	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec ~]# puppet config print modulepath --section master --environment blah
2014-07-30 09:53:06	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec ~]#
2014-07-30 09:53:18	jazoff	so, i'm going to guess that it is more something with the consoles ENC thing not putting the node in the right environment in the first place
2014-07-30 09:53:47	soehlert	welp here's the issue..
2014-07-30 09:53:50	soehlert	[root@repo-sec ~]# puppet config print modulepath --section master --environment development
2014-07-30 09:53:50	soehlert	/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
2014-07-30 09:54:11	soehlert	unless i misunderstand the command. thats a dev machine that and it's not seeing environments
2014-07-30 09:54:31	jazoff	i don't think that is supposed to work
2014-07-30 09:54:42	soehlert	ah ok
2014-07-30 09:54:57	jazoff	repo-sec doesn't know anything about the environment configs
2014-07-30 09:54:58	soehlert	do you know how i check what environment its in from repo-sec? i think theres supposed to be a way
2014-07-30 09:56:54	jazoff	no
2014-07-30 09:57:17	soehlert	k i'll poke around after the CA meeting to see if that's possible and start there
2014-07-30 09:57:27	jazoff	oh, hmmm
2014-07-30 09:58:24	soehlert	so this may be related, they word it strangely though, makes it seem like pe-puppet it should work as is, but idk
2014-07-30 09:58:26	soehlert	http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3.6/reference/dirs_confdir.html#system-and-user-confdirs
2014-07-30 09:59:32	jazoff	i mean, /etc/motd says production
2014-07-30 10:12:26	jazoff	ah, and there is still one more ssl error
2014-07-30 10:12:31	jazoff	/nodes/repo-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu
2014-07-30 10:12:32	jazoff	er
2014-07-30 10:12:35	jazoff	2014-07-30 10:12:28,686 | WARN  | Transport Connection to: tcp://141.142.148.96:57636 failed: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: unknown_ca | org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnection.Transport | ActiveMQ Transport: ssl:///141.142.148.96:57636
2014-07-30 10:21:15	jazoff	oh, i removed the certs and it recreated it, but i think that error is fine
2014-07-30 10:21:24	jazoff	those are just boxes that aren't using the new puppetmaste ryet
2014-07-30 10:33:54	soehlert	production is the default so you really have to test on a dev box (such as repo-sec)
2014-07-30 10:34:17	soehlert	as in you make changes in dev and they don't propogate out to the dev hosts. thats the issue we have now
2014-07-30 10:34:39	soehlert	the motd works still since we're explicitly setting the fact it's looking at
2014-07-30 10:41:42	jazoff	no.. we set the role/profile not the environment
2014-07-30 10:41:57	soehlert	we set the environment as well
2014-07-30 10:42:05	soehlert	in the WUI
2014-07-30 10:42:10	jazoff	yes.. that's the ONLY place it is set
2014-07-30 10:42:13	jazoff	and that is what isn't working
2014-07-30 10:42:36	soehlert	that part is working. repo-sec reports it's a development server
2014-07-30 10:42:47	jazoff	oh? where?
2014-07-30 10:42:50	jazoff	i didn't see it ever do that
2014-07-30 10:43:03	jazoff	oohh, the motd says development
2014-07-30 10:43:07	soehlert	ya
2014-07-30 10:43:11	jazoff	could have sworn I just looked at that and it said production
2014-07-30 10:43:14	soehlert	so clearly it's getting set right?
2014-07-30 10:43:22	soehlert	maybe you were on puppet-sec still?
2014-07-30 10:43:27	jazoff	oh maybe
2014-07-30 10:43:59	jazoff	the first thing it does is
2014-07-30 10:44:00	jazoff	141.142.148.26 - - [30/Jul/2014:10:43:49 -0500] "GET /production/node/repo-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu?transaction_uuid=96965f46-986d-4fbe-b3dc-3fa572d8f9dc&fail_

2014-07-30 10:45:16	jazoff	the role and profile facts show up, but not the environment
2014-07-30 10:45:40	jazoff	though tht may be normal
2014-07-30 10:46:40	jazoff	hmm
2014-07-30 10:46:53	jazoff	does having environment = production in the puppet conf file mess that up?
2014-07-30 10:46:59	jazoff	oh
2014-07-30 10:47:03	jazoff	"If you are using an ENC and it specifies an environment for that node, it will override whatever is in the config file."

2014-07-30 11:04:49	soehlert	so that's weird because in January this worked great for us, but now with the new release that supposedly fixed it, it's broken...
2014-07-30 11:05:00	jazoff	yeah..
2014-07-30 11:05:55	soehlert	sounds like you're resigned to go to support?
2014-07-30 11:06:19	jazoff	yeah, that's not it...
2014-07-30 11:06:25	jazoff	if I comment out the environment setting on the client
2014-07-30 11:06:28	jazoff	it still uses production
2014-07-30 11:07:04	jazoff	need to figure out how to curl the result of the ENC
2014-07-30 11:07:09	jazoff	or at least verify that it is giving the wrong thing
2014-07-30 11:07:19	soehlert	ya that would help. 
2014-07-30 11:11:37	jazoff	ah, I see what you're supposed to wget
2014-07-30 11:12:49	jazoff	ok, so it returns

2014-07-30 11:14:47	jazoff	tweked it a little
2014-07-30 11:14:55	jazoff	see /tmp/console_curl on puppet-sec
2014-07-30 11:15:34	soehlert	thats a pretty cool little script there..
2014-07-30 11:16:03	soehlert	theoretically should work for the most part from other machines right?
2014-07-30 11:16:19	soehlert	changing the CONSOLE var obviously
2014-07-30 11:16:20	jazoff	no.. i don't think you can talk to that from other machines
2014-07-30 11:16:35	soehlert	well i mean i guess just the curl part
2014-07-30 11:18:49	soehlert	or what was the wget command you used. i guess that's all we need for the other hosts
2014-07-30 11:21:43	-->	keist (jschipp@hidden-E95C13A8.ncsa.illinois.edu) has joined #puppet
2014-07-30 11:23:12	jazoff	see https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/21902
2014-07-30 11:23:24	jazoff	they show the same thing, the environment shouldn't be under parameters
2014-07-30 11:24:50	soehlert	weird that it worked before. so theoretically we should just remove it in the WUI and do it in the puppet.conf on the host?
2014-07-30 11:29:47	soehlert	nope that doesnt work
2014-07-30 11:29:48	jazoff	well, that seems like it would work
2014-07-30 11:31:21	soehlert	seems like it would, but changes made to the repo module are not being made on repo-sec.
2014-07-30 11:33:37	jazoff	is it still fetching the production modules?
2014-07-30 11:34:29	jazoff	oh, hmmmm
2014-07-30 11:34:49	soehlert	nope. changes are not seen in production module either
2014-07-30 11:43:05	soehlert	oh hmmm?
2014-07-30 11:44:30	jazoff	i'm confused
2014-07-30 11:44:42	soehlert	that makes two of us. i was hoping the hmm meant you had an idea
2014-07-30 11:44:52	jazoff	141.142.148.26 - - [30/Jul/2014:11:44:40 -0500] "GET /development/node/repo-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu

2014-07-30 11:45:08	jazoff	looks like it is grabing the right files
2014-07-30 11:48:33	keist	I noticed that typing environment under Key in the WUI doesn't show it as an option in the drop-down like it used to in the web interface, don't know if that has anything to do it with it but I think that it might because Role::Profile is presented as an option in the other input box so the drop-down functionality is still there
2014-07-30 11:49:08	jazoff	role::profile  is a class but the environment is just a parameter
2014-07-30 11:49:16	soehlert	the role::profile is just because it's loaded as a class. no option to do that with parameters
2014-07-30 11:50:11	keist	I'm not talking about *what they are* but about the missing functionality
2014-07-30 11:50:24	soehlert	right but you can't get that functionality for one because of what it is
2014-07-30 11:50:46	jazoff	i didn't think that was missing.. i didn't think environment ever showed up there
2014-07-30 11:50:54	keist	it always did, it was tehre
2014-07-30 11:51:00	soehlert	no idea why it worked before for environment. i just assumed it was due to FF trying to autofill. I figure that because it had my mistypings as an option too for me.
2014-07-30 11:51:19	keist	I remember because I liked it that I didn't have to type it out
2014-07-30 11:51:24	jazoff	yeah, it is definitely this problem https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/ENTERPRISE-33
2014-07-30 11:51:49	soehlert	but shouldn't it still work if we don't use the ENC to set the env?
2014-07-30 11:52:13	jazoff	yes, and the logs I pasted a few minutes ago shows that it IS working
2014-07-30 11:52:31	soehlert	so then how come it's not making the changes?
2014-07-30 11:52:44	jazoff	i dunno what you are expecting it to change
2014-07-30 11:53:05	soehlert	i keep changing a port number just because it should change something then, but it's not working
2014-07-30 11:54:50	jazoff	the port is already 80...
2014-07-30 11:54:59	soehlert	and ive tried changing it to 81 and nothing happens
2014-07-30 11:55:24	soehlert	unless git isnt working right...it says 81 in my copy of repo/manifests/init.pp
2014-07-30 11:55:37	jazoff	it looks like you changed it to 81 and then back to 80
2014-07-30 11:55:40	soehlert	ahh maybe it is a git issue..says 80 on puppet-sec
2014-07-30 11:55:47	soehlert	nope still 81 on mine. i'll try again
2014-07-30 11:56:23	jazoff	did you push?

2014-07-30 11:56:35	soehlert	yes
2014-07-30 11:56:35	soehlert	just tried again with 88...port ive never done
2014-07-30 11:56:36	jazoff	is the latest one the puppet server has
2014-07-30 11:56:41	jazoff	which is you changing it from 81 back to 80
2014-07-30 11:56:57	soehlert	after it failed on 80
2014-07-30 11:57:09	soehlert	errr after it failed changing it to 81. i just set it to 88 and its not updating the port
2014-07-30 11:57:12	soehlert	on puppet-sec
2014-07-30 11:57:21	jazoff	right, but I'm just saying the port is currently 80 and the config has 80 so ther is nothing to debug...
2014-07-30 11:57:31	soehlert	except i pushed port 88 about 2 minutes ago
2014-07-30 11:57:35	soehlert	so there should be a change
2014-07-30 11:57:41	jazoff	is the webhook broken?

2014-07-30 11:58:20	jazoff	did the IP change?

2014-07-30 11:59:34	jazoff	oh, wrong host
2014-07-30 11:59:41	jazoff	ok, right host works
2014-07-30 12:00:33	jazoff	oooooh
2014-07-30 12:00:37	jazoff	the ssh keys changed
2014-07-30 12:00:40	jazoff	so git pull is probably broke
2014-07-30 12:01:12	soehlert	i thought i fixed that..
2014-07-30 12:01:30	soehlert	ya seems to be working on puppet-sec
2014-07-30 12:03:56	jazoff	oh
2014-07-30 12:04:11	soehlert	hmmm git-sec WUI shows that my push worked so it must be between puppet-sec and git-sec somehow
2014-07-30 12:04:28	jazoff	oh, you pushed to production
2014-07-30 12:04:32	soehlert	puppet-sec pulls say already up to date, but they're wrong. i wonder why
2014-07-30 12:04:37	soehlert	ah adlk;ha;lskjf
2014-07-30 12:06:01	soehlert	aaaand there we are. so basically we can't use the ENC for env and we're fine
2014-07-31 11:21:53	keist	jazoff: I all my hosts are receiving this on a puppet agent run:

2014-07-31 11:22:35	keist	Do you know how to fix? I moved the puppetlabs/puppet/ssl directory and then re-ran agent, it suggested running puppet clean cert <node> on puppet-sec so I did that
2014-07-31 11:23:02	keist	followed this:
2014-07-31 11:23:03	keist	On the master:

2014-07-31 11:33:13	jazoff	that should do it
2014-07-31 11:33:22	jazoff	since it HAS a cert it doesn't re-submit it
2014-07-31 11:33:30	jazoff	removing it will make it regenerate a new CSR

2014-07-31 12:01:43	jazoff	did someone do the puppet cert clean?
2014-07-31 12:02:26	keist	yeah, soehlert sent me this article so I tried what was in here: http://fvtool.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/exiting-no-certificate-found-and-waitforcert-is-disabled-installing-puppet/
2014-07-31 12:02:36	keist	but I was receiving that before I even tried it
2014-07-31 12:02:56	jazoff	lemme see
2014-07-31 12:08:49	jazoff	the puppet.conf looks broken
2014-07-31 12:09:24	jazoff	that might have worked..
2014-07-31 12:09:48	jazoff	hmm

2014-07-31 12:18:31	jazoff	repo-sec was working yesteday now it's not
2014-07-31 12:20:06	jazoff	oh, did I clean that my mistake? heh
2014-07-31 12:20:14	jazoff	that explains why repo-sec is gone and nagios-sec is still tehre
2014-07-31 12:20:17	soehlert	clean what?
2014-07-31 12:20:27	soehlert	oh you accidentally did puppet cert clean repo-sec?
2014-07-31 12:20:38	jazoff	maybe
2014-07-31 12:21:41	jazoff	weird, it ends up in

2014-07-31 12:21:50	jazoff	but the ca tool doesn't show it as needing to be signed
2014-07-31 12:22:06	soehlert	isnt it puppet cert sign not puppet ca sign?
2014-07-31 12:22:42	jazoff	hmm
2014-07-31 12:22:52	jazoff	seem to do the same thing
2014-07-31 12:22:56	soehlert	ah ok
2014-07-31 12:23:02	jazoff	restarting puppet
2014-07-31 12:23:05	jazoff	maybe it's just confused
2014-07-31 12:27:19	jazoff	yeah, /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/nagios-sec.internal.ncsa.edu.pem comes back, but it's never getting signed
2014-07-31 12:27:29	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec ~]# puppet ca  sign nagios-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu
2014-07-31 12:27:30	jazoff	Could not find certificate request for nagios-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu
2014-07-31 12:27:37	jazoff	but it shows up in list
2014-07-31 12:27:40	jazoff	even though it's not signed
2014-07-31 12:32:51	jazoff	grr, this was working yesterday
2014-07-31 12:33:22	jazoff	regenerating and signing the cert on repo-sec ends up with
2014-07-31 12:33:23	jazoff	Error: Could not send report: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server session ticket A: sslv3 alert certificate revoked
2014-07-31 12:47:18	jazoff	ok, think I know what is causing that
2014-07-31 13:22:11	soehlert	?
2014-07-31 13:22:54	jazoff	meh
2014-07-31 13:22:59	jazoff	nothing is workingto fix that
2014-07-31 13:25:06	jazoff	i think it's reusing ssl cert serial numbers
2014-07-31 13:25:26	jazoff	wonder if one can just clear out the puppet master CRL
2014-07-31 13:28:35	jazoff	ah, maybe easier idea.. bump up the serial to 99
2014-07-31 13:28:44	jazoff	so that new certs should definitely not be revoked
2014-07-31 13:29:15	soehlert	wait so it's using a cert serial that was previously revoked?
2014-07-31 13:29:22	jazoff	that's what it seems to be doing
2014-07-31 13:29:45	soehlert	well thats dumb.
2014-07-31 13:32:26	jazoff	hmm, that sorta helped
2014-07-31 13:32:32	jazoff	now puppetdb is complaing that it is revoked
2014-07-31 13:32:37	jazoff	maybe just need to restart that too
2014-07-31 13:33:02	soehlert	probably
2014-07-31 13:33:14	jazoff	oh, different error i see
2014-07-31 13:33:24	soehlert	?
2014-07-31 13:33:36	jazoff	Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Failed to submit 'replace facts' command for repo-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu to PuppetDB at puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu:8081: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed: [certificate revoked for /CN=puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu]
2014-07-31 13:34:03	soehlert	thats a different one? looks like its still a revoked cert
2014-07-31 13:35:16	jazoff	yeah, but that's between puppet-sec and puppetdb
2014-07-31 13:35:39	soehlert	which is on puppet-sec
2014-07-31 13:36:08	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec log]# /opt/puppet/sbin/puppetdb ssl-setup

2014-07-31 13:36:14	jazoff	again!?
2014-07-31 13:36:25	soehlert	oh for fucks sake
2014-07-31 13:37:34	jazoff	FIXED
2014-07-31 13:37:46	soehlert	how?
2014-07-31 13:37:54	jazoff	re-ran that command with -f
2014-07-31 13:38:02	jazoff	but the main thing that fixed it was bumping up that serial number for ssl
2014-07-31 13:38:16	soehlert	ahhh well damn good catch there
2014-07-31 13:38:54	jazoff	puppet ca output is still fucked
2014-07-31 13:39:18	jazoff	but blinding running the sign command works
2014-07-31 13:39:32	jazoff	nagios-sec working now
2014-07-31 13:39:32	soehlert	still fucked how?
2014-07-31 13:40:16	jazoff	hmm, maybe they changed it
2014-07-31 13:40:20	jazoff	it used to have 2 lists
2014-07-31 13:40:27	jazoff	signed certs and then "certs needing to be signed"
2014-07-31 13:41:25	jazoff	oh, maybe you need --all for that now
2014-07-31 13:41:47	jazoff	ok, i think it is fine, they just changed the output
2014-07-31 13:42:47	jazoff	you want to try adding another node?
2014-07-31 13:43:01	soehlert	ahhh ya i think that sounds familiar
2014-07-31 13:43:01	soehlert	ive read too much about this that its all just blending together at this point
2014-07-31 13:43:07	soehlert	umm sure i guess gimme a minute
2014-07-31 14:11:03	soehlert	so it looks like the WUI is not seeing the requests but puppet cert sign --all works
2014-07-31 14:11:20	jazoff	ah, maybe something screwy is going on
2014-07-31 14:11:31	jazoff	i didnt know you could sign them through the website anyway
2014-07-31 14:11:34	jazoff	where do they show up?
2014-07-31 14:11:47	soehlert	top right next to the license when there is one it says 1 node request
2014-07-31 14:11:53	jazoff	ah
2014-07-31 14:19:55	soehlert	oh definite issues: "SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server session ticket A: sslv3 alert certificate revoked"
2014-07-31 14:19:55	soehlert	when I try to edit role::profile
2014-07-31 14:20:08	jazoff	what box is that?
2014-07-31 14:20:13	soehlert	from the WUI
2014-07-31 14:20:19	jazoff	oh
2014-07-31 14:21:36	jazoff	https://ask.puppetlabs.com/question/1547/puppet-enterprise-inventory-ssl-error/
2014-07-31 14:21:37	jazoff	try that
2014-07-31 14:33:35	soehlert	seems to have worked thanks
2014-08-01 08:29:51	jazoff	something changed on the new puppet master that wants to make all files owned by pe-puppet if they aren't specified in the manifest
2014-08-01 08:59:09	jazoff	oh, it's just the owners of the files in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/development/
2014-08-01 08:59:22	jazoff	i think there is an option you can put that makes files default to root/root
2014-08-01 09:58:45	soehlert	ok i'll look into it today
2014-08-01 10:11:34	jazoff	i think it's something in one of the conf files for fileserver, or maybe you do like File { ... } in site.pp
2014-08-01 10:11:38	jazoff	actually, I think i had this at UA..
2014-08-01 10:12:00	jazoff	oh, have File { ignore => ['.svn', '.git', 'CVS' ] }
2014-08-01 10:12:04	jazoff	i think you can do File { 
2014-08-01 10:12:12	jazoff	  owner => root, group => root }
2014-08-01 10:12:17	jazoff	and it will change the default for files
2014-08-01 11:01:00	soehlert	jazoff: what's up with the modules thing in puppte_configs in git
2014-08-01 11:09:06	jazoff	i dunno
2014-08-01 11:09:25	jazoff	git log modules :)
2014-08-01 11:09:33	soehlert	the only thing in it is a bro script
2014-08-01 11:09:44	soehlert	the archival script
2014-08-01 11:09:46	jazoff	yeah, git rm it
2014-08-01 11:09:55	jazoff	something must have happened during a merge
2014-08-01 11:10:06	soehlert	ok. that was a very long winded way of asking if modules needs to exist at that location.
2014-08-01 11:11:26	jazoff	no 
2014-08-01 11:11:27	jazoff	:)
2014-08-01 11:34:43	soehlert	where does the site.pp file live?
2014-08-01 11:34:53	jazoff	manifests
2014-08-01 11:35:15	soehlert	so theres a different one for each environment?
2014-08-01 11:36:06	soehlert	though i guess i just need to change the one for production.
2014-08-01 11:38:55	jazoff	hmmm? both should be the same
2014-08-01 11:39:02	jazoff	change the one in dev and then merge into production
2014-08-01 11:43:10	soehlert	but there won't be a way to test the dev one right? since puppet-sec is production.
2014-08-01 11:50:23	jazoff	oh, that doesn't matter
2014-08-01 11:50:30	jazoff	just need to test it from a machine that IS development
2014-08-01 11:50:39	jazoff	i noticed this on bro-dev after I added it
2014-08-01 11:50:47	jazoff	fixed some things in the bro module and then reembered you could do it globally
2014-08-01 11:51:15	soehlert	oooo i thought you were saying the files on puppet-sec in the /etc/puppetlabs/puppet dirs were owned pe-puppet that weren't supposed to
2014-08-01 11:54:52	jazoff	they are.. 
2014-08-01 11:55:08	jazoff	but rather than chown then i think it is even better to tell puppet to default to root/root
2014-08-01 12:09:59	soehlert	hmm i think i did it wrong then. i'm presuming the development environment should be owned by root:root now right?
2014-08-01 12:10:57	jazoff	lemme see
2014-08-01 12:11:37	jazoff	you mean the files? no
2014-08-01 12:11:44	jazoff	this will just control file resources
2014-08-01 12:12:31	jazoff	Aug  1 12:07:34 bro-dev puppet-agent[38956]: (/Stage[main]/Smtp::Msp/File[/etc/cron.d/smtp]/owner) owner changed 'pe-puppet' to 'root'
2014-08-01 12:12:34	jazoff	Aug  1 12:07:34 bro-dev puppet-agent[38956]: (/Stage[main]/Smtp::Msp/File[/etc/cron.d/smtp]/group) group changed 'pe-puppet' to 'root'
2014-08-01 12:12:38	jazoff	looks like it worked
2014-08-01 12:13:27	soehlert	ahh ok
2014-08-01 12:13:34	soehlert	i was confused what you were going for clearly
2014-08-01 13:28:26	soehlert	ughhh certificate revoked errors when i add a new host. 
2014-08-01 13:31:35	jazoff	what host?
2014-08-01 13:33:15	soehlert	polot
2014-08-01 13:34:26	jazoff	ah, that's puppetdb again
2014-08-01 13:35:21	jazoff	ok, something is fucking with the ssl certs
2014-08-01 13:35:25	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec log]# /opt/puppet/sbin/puppetdb ssl-setup
2014-08-01 13:35:26	jazoff	PEM files in /etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/ssl already exists, checking integrity.

2014-08-01 13:36:33	soehlert	ugh this is really pissing me off. 
2014-08-01 13:38:26	jazoff	i don't understand why it keeps breaking
2014-08-01 13:38:35	soehlert	this is the part that keeps pissing me off
2014-08-01 14:56:54	soehlert	i think i might have made it so we have to redo the certs on the other machines, buuuuuutt i think i permanently fixed our revoked certs issue 
2014-08-01 14:56:54	 *	soehlert crosses fingers
2014-08-01 15:27:12	jazoff	so I know what caused the revoked certs issue, no idea why things seem to be changing on their own though
2014-08-01 15:27:23	jazoff	i thought stuff was fixed andthen it broke again
2014-08-01 15:28:56	soehlert	well this seemed to work for the revoked certs thing:http://honglus.blogspot.be/2012/01/force-puppet-agent-to-regenerate.html
2014-08-01 15:29:09	soehlert	and in fact, the node requests look like they'll show up in the WUI
2014-08-11 14:20:04	soehlert	jazoff: im blanking here. made a new rsyslog type for the polo machines (don't ask, it's a PITA) but it keeps grabbing the rsyslog.conf from the rsyslog::forwarder class. how can i make it ignore that?
2014-08-11 14:20:37	jazoff	what's polo again?
2014-08-11 14:20:50	soehlert	some ca related crap for terry and jim basney
2014-08-11 14:20:53	jazoff	ah
2014-08-11 14:21:10	jazoff	is type set?
2014-08-11 14:21:18	soehlert	?
2014-08-11 14:21:36	soehlert	you mean role::profile?
2014-08-11 14:21:43	jazoff	class rsyslog ( $type = "forwarder" ){
2014-08-11 14:21:44	jazoff	··
2014-08-11 14:21:44	jazoff	  case $type {
2014-08-11 14:21:53	jazoff	if type isn't what you think it is, it will default to forwarder
2014-08-11 14:22:08	soehlert	ah hell thats the issue..thanks
2014-08-11 14:22:16	jazoff	:)
2014-08-11 14:22:18	soehlert	forgot we had that part and just copied another class basically

2014-08-13 14:34:39	soehlert	can someone take a peek at the ssh module? and the dev/services/scanner.yaml. I keep getting: "Invalid relationship: File[/etc/ssh/sshd_config] { require => Package[undef] }, because Package[undef] doesn't seem to be in the catalog"
2014-08-13 14:38:32	jazoff	no, but     require    => Package[$ssh_packages], 
2014-08-13 14:38:33	jazoff	is
2014-08-13 14:38:36	jazoff	and $ssh_packages must be undef
2014-08-13 14:39:17	soehlert	well right, but i don't see how
2014-08-13 14:39:17	soehlert	i understand the error message it just doesn't make sense to me since i set that
2014-08-13 14:39:32	jazoff	wellll i'm not saying you didn't mean to set it
2014-08-13 14:39:36	jazoff	but clearly it is not set :)
2014-08-13 14:40:01	soehlert	well right, and im asking why it's not getting set. i did it the same way we do other stuff that works
2014-08-13 14:41:15	jazoff	hmm
2014-08-13 14:42:00	jazoff	hmmm
2014-08-13 14:42:12	jazoff	yeah, it should be set from hieradata/development/common.yaml
2014-08-13 14:42:30	soehlert	well not there as im only testing it on the scanner. that's why i pointed you to the services/scanner.yaml
2014-08-13 14:42:58	jazoff	that shouldn't matter
2014-08-13 14:43:02	jazoff	  - "%{::environment}/common" 
2014-08-13 14:43:05	jazoff	is in the hiera config
2014-08-13 14:43:19	soehlert	well i guess that's true but the ssh module is only set in the scanner one
2014-08-13 14:43:27	soehlert	is basically what im trying to point out
2014-08-13 14:44:07	jazoff	oh
2014-08-13 14:47:02	jazoff	i don't see anything obvious
2014-08-13 14:48:03	soehlert	crap. i dont either.
2014-08-13 14:48:46	jazoff	ok, as a test
2014-08-13 14:48:51	jazoff	chanage
2014-08-13 14:48:52	jazoff	class ssh::common ( $ssh_packages ) {
2014-08-13 14:48:53	jazoff	to
2014-08-13 14:49:04	jazoff	class ssh::common ( $ssh_packages = ['openssh-server','openssh-clients']) {
2014-08-13 14:49:04	soehlert	i've explicitly set it there before if thats what youre doing
2014-08-13 14:49:58	soehlert	but im tryin again
2014-08-13 14:50:35	soehlert	hmm well it ran that time but didnt change anything
2014-08-13 14:50:47	soehlert	oh wait it did. just didn't tell me..
2014-08-13 14:56:19	soehlert	sweet that seemed to work
2014-08-13 14:56:27	soehlert	tomorrow i'll work on pushing out the standard stuff to all dev hosts
2014-08-13 14:57:12	jazoff	ok
2014-08-13 14:57:17	soehlert	well and making it so i dont have to explicitly set the packages in the manifest
2014-08-14 14:29:28	soehlert	jazoff: supercell is failing puppet runs
2014-08-14 14:36:55	jazoff	oh?
2014-08-14 14:36:56	jazoff	lemme see
2014-08-14 14:37:31	jazoff	ah, my fauly
2014-08-14 14:38:12	soehlert	so now that I got you in the puppet mood... :)
2014-08-14 14:38:40	soehlert	trying to get the sshd stuff out in development, but for some reason it was passing out the template instead of the sshd_config-standard file i set up. i see no reason why it would do that do you?
2014-08-14 14:39:56	jazoff	what template?
2014-08-14 14:40:10	soehlert	well i ended up deleting it and its still pulling from the template..
2014-08-14 14:40:18	soehlert	there was an sshd_conf.erb file
2014-08-14 14:40:47	soehlert	but after deleting that i added a comment in sshd_conf on wiki-sec then ran puppet and it removed the comment, but set it to be how the template was set up and not the sshd_conf-standard file it should be
2014-08-14 14:47:51	jazoff	are you in the wrong environment?
2014-08-14 14:47:57	jazoff	there is no ssh template anymore
2014-08-14 14:48:26	soehlert	crap i was looking at the environment on the WUI...
2014-08-14 14:49:10	soehlert	ugh welp thanks for quickly finding my stupidity..looks like it works
2014-08-15 13:55:33	soehlert	jazoff: supercell is still failing tying to set owner and group of /data/bro.
2014-08-15 14:20:21	jazoff	oh? I thought I fixed that
2014-08-15 14:21:53	jazoff	just going to reboot portal-sec, working on other things and don't have time to debug
2014-08-15 14:21:59	jazoff	should come back up properly after reboot
2014-08-15 14:27:17	soehlert	ok
2014-08-15 14:43:21	jazoff	or or notor not
2014-08-15 14:43:35	jazoff	wonder why it is having trouble all of a sudden
2014-08-15 14:43:46	soehlert	ya i was wondering but hadnt dug to see if you made a change recently
2014-08-15 15:39:05	jazoff	puppet on supercell fixed
2014-08-15 15:53:45	soehlert	ssh standard profile seems to be working well
2014-08-15 15:53:49	jazoff	:)
2014-08-15 15:54:21	soehlert	thats nice. one less thing for me to do on new hosts. granted this latest is a test bastion so thats going to need to be ripped out and replaced in due time..
2014-08-15 15:54:53	jazoff	what happened with the template? too complicated?
2014-08-15 15:55:24	soehlert	ya basically. i mean theres only three versions of the sshd_conf but they are pretty vastly different.
2014-08-15 15:55:42	soehlert	plus it made it so much easier to at least get the standard image finished for now
2014-08-15 15:55:57	soehlert	20% of the work for 80% of the payout and that whole thing
2014-08-15 15:56:56	jazoff	yeah
2014-08-15 15:57:13	soehlert	lets me deal with the bastion stuff when i have more time too which is nice
2014-08-15 15:57:33	jazoff	it definitely makes sense to do just do different files at first
2014-08-15 15:57:52	jazoff	when it's all done, if we realize the files are 100% the same except for 1 line, then it's easy to template it
2014-08-15 15:58:16	soehlert	ya in the future we can come back and do it template style. that will also give us three definitive ones to base off of. i know before some of the ones we were using were done by hand and so had slight differences
2014-08-15 15:58:39	soehlert	this way we'll have the bastion, intra_bastion and standard one all nailed on exactly how we need them before deciding how to template
2014-08-15 16:02:30	soehlert	so it seems the new install stuff is not installing the facter/facts.d dirs. not sure what to do. 
2014-08-15 16:02:30	soehlert	just been manually creating them after the first puppet run, but i was thinking of adding it to the install.bash script that puppet runs to install the agent
2014-08-15 16:02:42	soehlert	my concern there is it will be overwritten/removed in the future
2014-08-15 16:03:59	jazoff	can't you just tell puppet to create them?
2014-08-15 16:04:33	soehlert	i guess that works, we'll just have to run puppet 3 times before it doesn't fail, but thats fine i suppose

2014-09-03 13:20:13	soehlert	jazoff: im really confused. drought doesnt have a role::profile yet, but it's getting an error on first run Invalid relationship: File[/etc/munin/plugins/proc_bro]
2014-09-03 13:29:09	jazoff	uhh
2014-09-03 13:30:28	jazoff	that is odd
2014-09-03 13:34:29	jazoff	ooh
2014-09-03 13:34:33	jazoff	maybe it's an epel thing
2014-09-03 13:34:40	soehlert	?
2014-09-03 13:35:14	jazoff	ooh, i think i know
2014-09-03 13:35:54	soehlert	and it is?
2014-09-03 13:36:05	jazoff	hmmm maybe not
2014-09-03 13:36:11	jazoff	that wouldn't explain why it worked on the other 5 machines
2014-09-03 13:36:23	jazoff	it just looks like munin::node is missing
2014-09-03 13:36:43	jazoff	the plugin class doesnt auto include it
2014-09-03 13:37:00	soehlert	is munin::node in common?
2014-09-03 13:37:06	soehlert	or is this a bro only thing?
2014-09-03 13:37:19	jazoff	mostly a bro thing
2014-09-03 13:37:45	jazoff	but it wouldn't be trying to load the proc_bro thing unless it was running the bro module
2014-09-03 13:39:02	soehlert	right which is what im getting at. i cant figure out why it's doing that
2014-09-03 13:40:15	jazoff	oooh, there is the host file in heira
2014-09-03 13:40:20	jazoff	classes:
2014-09-03 13:40:20	jazoff	    - bro::worker
2014-09-03 13:40:20	jazoff	bro::capture_lib: 'myricom'
2014-09-03 13:40:20	jazoff	bro::worker::capture_lib: 'myricom'
2014-09-03 13:40:33	soehlert	ahhh can we ditch the host file?
2014-09-03 13:40:36	jazoff	bro::worekr shouldn't be there
2014-09-03 13:40:40	jazoff	we need the other stuff though
2014-09-03 13:40:57	soehlert	is there a way we can avoid using host specific files though? can we make a new profile for this?
2014-09-03 13:41:13	jazoff	no, the myricom/pfring stuff is per host
2014-09-03 13:41:32	soehlert	well right but cant we have a myricom_bro_worker and pfring_bro_worker
2014-09-03 13:41:40	jazoff	we could, but that would be a ton of work
2014-09-03 13:41:58	jazoff	can probably set the variables in the puppet console though
2014-09-03 13:42:09	jazoff	and assign them via a group
2014-09-03 13:42:19	jazoff	was just easier a while back to stick it in hiera
2014-09-03 13:42:20	soehlert	why would it be a ton of work. it would basically be the same files that exist as host files right?
2014-09-03 13:42:47	jazoff	hmmmmmmmmm
2014-09-03 13:42:49	jazoff	mayyybe
2014-09-03 13:43:00	jazoff	so nids-dev1 and drought are both bro/worker
2014-09-03 13:43:08	jazoff	which keeps things simple there
2014-09-03 13:43:38	jazoff	and then the only thing that changes is the myricom thing, so that was easier than having two different profiles
2014-09-03 13:44:01	soehlert	the puppet code doesnt have to change its just a hiera change to using environments and role::profile vs hosts which 1) if we spin up a new machine we have to do a separate hosts file for that 2) i don't think to look at hosts because i was trying to keep the stuff broad so i never know what hosts are done individually (minor quibble i know) 3) do they still get a role::profile if theres a host?
2014-09-03 13:44:26	jazoff	i think making a bro/worker_pfring and bro/worker_myricom might not be too bad, but it can get messy
2014-09-03 13:44:34	jazoff	yeah, they still have a role::profile
2014-09-03 13:47:03	jazoff	well, that seems to have fixed it
2014-09-03 13:49:26	soehlert	ya it's working now. I just would like to avoid being pigeonholed by the host files. i'd rather make things broad and repeatable. that's my argument, but the bro stuff is yours so however works best for you.
2014-09-03 13:50:32	soehlert	and just in case it's not clear thanks to text not conveying tone, i'm not being a smartass or anything
2014-09-03 13:53:50	soehlert	ok drought should be good to go kerberos included
2014-09-03 13:54:56	jazoff	yeah, I will think about this
2014-09-03 13:55:14	jazoff	was more of a bandaid anyway, but i'm not sure what the better approach is
2014-09-03 13:55:30	jazoff	the problem with naming the profile worker_pfring is where does it stop?
2014-09-03 13:55:40	jazoff	do you end up with worker_pfring_2.2 ?
2014-09-03 14:01:56	soehlert	or could you just do bro, bro-dev, and bro-third or whatever and then have something you set in hiera like: bro::interface: pfring or myricom
2014-09-03 14:02:00	soehlert	and then one for version too?
2014-09-03 14:04:04	jazoff	well the problem at the time was we had bro-dev and drought which was also bro development
2014-09-03 14:04:12	jazoff	but bro-dev was pfring and drought was myricom
2014-09-03 14:04:15	jazoff	but otherwise 100% the same
2014-09-03 14:04:31	jazoff	and actually supercell was teh same too, just some needed pfring and some needed myricom
2014-09-03 14:07:15	soehlert	right but i mean we can name them different things and have them load the same module just do the pfring or myricom. each "cluster" will be uniform amongst itself
2014-09-03 14:09:51	jazoff	yeahhh i suppose
2014-09-09 14:43:19	jschipp	btw, that environments still don't seem to be working. relays are still marked as development in /etc/motd (needs to be updated I know) but the changes only were availabled when i pushed to the production branch
2014-09-09 14:44:03	soehlert	are you making the changes in the file? the WUI does not work to set the environments
2014-09-09 14:48:35	jazoff	envs seemed to be working for me on the bro boxes
2014-09-09 14:52:15	soehlert	ya they work for me everywhere else too. i think jschipp forgot to set it properly in the puppet.conf
2014-09-09 14:52:43	soehlert	hmm nope turns out thats not true
2014-09-09 14:54:46	jazoff	well. here's what I know...
2014-09-09 14:55:00	jazoff	when I first ran puppet one some of the bro boxes, they grabbed the prod configs
2014-09-09 14:55:14	jazoff	after I changed the puppet conf to development, it worked correctly
2014-09-09 14:55:48	soehlert	i agree, things work just fine for me. i was hoping for jschipp's sake it'd be that easy fix

I created an ntp::ca class that gives it the proper config file and I tried creating a common class that had the package and service stuff, but service gets called twice then thanks to our ntp::disable class
2014-11-10 14:47:15	soehlert	all i can think of to do is pull that out of vmware/common.yaml and put it in bro/common.yaml, log/common.yaml, etc, etc. thoughts?
2014-11-10 14:55:52	jazoff	hmm
2014-11-10 14:56:36	jazoff	yeah that's tricky
2014-11-10 14:56:39	soehlert	and actually that wouldn't work would it?
2014-11-10 14:56:47	soehlert	because that would apply to everyone.
2014-11-10 14:57:41	soehlert	maybe some sort of case statement in the ntp class and somehow exclude based on hostname
2014-11-10 14:58:01	jazoff	maybe.. 
2014-11-10 14:58:11	jazoff	i think with something like this there isn't going to be a neat solution
2014-11-10 14:58:36	jazoff	the whole 'all vms should not have ntp except for these 2' ruins the convention
2014-11-10 14:58:54	soehlert	oh i know it kills the convention.
2014-11-10 14:59:05	soehlert	but that's just going to have to happen.
2014-11-10 14:59:51	soehlert	wait could i make hosts yaml files for them and put ntp::ca in there? won't it come first and therefore override the common one? or is it still going to try to do both?
2014-11-10 15:00:22	jazoff	not sure 
2014-11-10 15:00:27	jazoff	you mean like with classes: ?
2014-11-10 15:00:35	jazoff	not sure what happens if you have something twice
2014-11-10 15:01:56	soehlert	well ya make host specific hiera files and put the ntp::class in there. but i think that would do the same thing it's currently doing. since it's grabbing the ca/common.yaml and the vmware/common.yaml
2014-11-10 15:02:19	jazoff	yeah
2014-11-10 15:02:25	jazoff	i guess that works
2014-11-10 15:03:02	soehlert	well thats the thing, it doesnt work
2014-11-10 15:07:27	jazoff	oh!
2014-11-10 15:07:32	jazoff	why not?
2014-11-10 15:07:52	jazoff	you removed the ntp disable from vmware common right?
2014-11-10 15:08:38	soehlert	no i didn't i didn't wanna do that yet until i had a plan. removing it from there then screws us for future vms
2014-11-10 15:09:08	jazoff	hmm ok, i think I see how to fix this
2014-11-10 15:09:21	jazoff	if we change ntp to be like sshd is and can have ntp::type
2014-11-10 15:09:29	jazoff	then we can set ntp::type to disable in vmware common
2014-11-10 15:09:43	jazoff	and set it ca in ca/common
2014-11-10 15:09:49	soehlert	but that will apply to these vms..
2014-11-10 15:09:55	jazoff	and because of the order in hiera that will work
2014-11-10 15:09:56	jazoff	right?
2014-11-10 15:10:04	soehlert	idk i guess i'll give it a go
2014-11-10 15:10:24	jazoff	like, you can't override ntp::disable to ntp::ca using hiera
2014-11-10 15:10:28	jazoff	as far as I know
2014-11-10 15:10:38	jazoff	since there's no way to do like
2014-11-10 15:10:41	jazoff	classes:
2014-11-10 15:10:46	jazoff	- -ntp::disable
2014-11-10 15:11:05	jazoff	but overriding ntp::type to 'ca' is definitely doable
2014-11-10 15:11:06	soehlert	right
2014-11-10 15:11:13	soehlert	ok well ill give that a try thanks
2014-11-10 15:11:40	jazoff	time for walk #2 :)
2014-11-10 15:24:20	jazoff	oook
2014-11-10 15:24:31	soehlert	not working :(
2014-11-10 15:24:37	jazoff	error?
2014-11-10 15:25:53	soehlert	no error, can you take a peek and make sure i did it right. it looks good to me, but ya konw it's tough to find errors in your own stuff sometimes
2014-11-10 15:27:13	jazoff	oh, we need to fix heira.com
2014-11-10 15:27:22	jazoff	move   - "%{::environment}/virtual/%{::virtual}" up
2014-11-10 15:28:06	soehlert	how far up?
2014-11-10 15:28:14	jazoff	well above the role profile
2014-11-10 15:28:34	soehlert	ok thats what i figured, but that seems like it would be backwards to me, i'll try
2014-11-10 15:29:04	soehlert	nope
2014-11-10 15:29:13	soehlert	added vmware_tools though which is weird..
2014-11-11 15:40:50	soehlert	hey jazoff look over here
2014-11-11 16:17:43	jazoff	hi
2014-11-11 16:18:20	jazoff	oh, did we not get the ntp thing working?
2014-11-11 16:18:57	jazoff	there was a command you could run that would print out a hiera variable for a host.. i forget what it is though
2014-11-11 16:19:03	jazoff	it was in my shell history on squall
2014-11-11 16:19:47	soehlert	ya i tried that and every response was 'nil' 
2014-11-11 16:20:10	soehlert	the other problem im running into is crashplan is restarting and replacing the conf file every time and i cant figure out how to make it stop
2014-11-11 16:20:29	jazoff	yeah, i had noticed that
2014-11-11 16:20:50	jazoff	if crashplan wants to change the config you can have puppet only deploy it initially
2014-11-11 16:21:01	soehlert	but crashplan shouldn't be change the config
2014-11-11 16:21:12	jazoff	one way to do taht is to push out a foo.cfg.dist file and exec a cp to foo.cfg if foo.cfg does not exist
2014-11-11 16:21:15	jazoff	ah, but clearly it is :)
2014-11-11 16:21:24	soehlert	well clearly something is.
2014-11-11 16:21:45	jazoff	copy the crashplan config to /tmp before puppet runs
2014-11-11 16:21:47	jazoff	then you can diff it
2014-11-11 16:22:01	jazoff	or just run that puppet apply -somethingorother that jschipp runs that shows teh diff
2014-11-11 16:22:08	soehlert	i just did that and i saw things like this: -            <lastModified>1415744001994</lastModified>
2014-11-11 16:22:08	soehlert	+            <lastModified>1380304885497</lastModified>
2014-11-11 16:22:15	soehlert	so that's going to always happen basically
2014-11-11 16:22:23	jazoff	ah
2014-11-11 16:22:25	jazoff	yep :)
2014-11-11 16:22:28	soehlert	so your exec cp idea is probably best
2014-11-11 16:23:26	jazoff	ah, well if it is showing nil for the other thing then the command must be off somehow
2014-11-11 16:23:32	jazoff	because it should at least show something
2014-11-11 16:23:38	soehlert	ya i probably did it wrong
2014-11-11 16:23:46	jazoff	it took me ages to get it to work
2014-11-11 16:23:46	soehlert	im not sure how to check for ntp::type 
2014-11-11 16:23:58	soehlert	i tried hiera ntp::type which seemed like the correct way...buuuut
2014-11-11 16:24:11	jazoff	what is the full comand you are running?
2014-11-11 16:25:59	soehlert	that was it haha `hiera ntp::type`
2014-11-11 16:25:59	soehlert	based on the quick look at docs that seemed right but i doubt it is
2014-11-11 16:26:23	jazoff	oh, it should be something like hiera -c /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml ntp::type hostname=splunki1.internal.ncsa.edu environment=development
2014-11-11 16:26:42	soehlert	ahhh
2014-11-11 16:27:37	soehlert	ok crashplan issue fixed
2014-11-11 16:33:19	jazoff	ah, it works
2014-11-11 16:33:24	jazoff	i remembered you need to prefix with ::
2014-11-11 16:33:34	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec puppet]# hiera  -c /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml ntp::type ::virtual=vmware ::environment=development
2014-11-11 16:33:37	jazoff	vm
2014-11-11 16:34:51	soehlert	aha
2014-11-11 16:34:54	soehlert	[root@puppet-sec puppet]# hiera  -c /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml ntp::type ::virtual=vmware ::environment=development ::clientcert="tepid.ncsa.illinois.edu"
2014-11-11 16:34:54	soehlert	vm
2014-11-11 16:35:07	soehlert	not sure if that clientcert part is right though i guess
2014-11-11 16:35:10	jazoff	[root@puppet-sec puppet]# hiera  -c /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml ntp::type role=ca ::profile=foo ::environment=development
2014-11-11 16:35:12	jazoff	ca
2014-11-11 16:35:30	soehlert	ya that can't be right
2014-11-11 16:35:31	jazoff	clientcert wouldn't come into play
2014-11-11 16:35:39	jazoff	how so? it looks right
2014-11-11 16:35:42	soehlert	how do you check based on a certain host then?
2014-11-11 16:35:54	soehlert	because i just tried it with splunki1-sec.internal.ncsa.edu and it said vm
2014-11-11 16:35:55	jazoff	i dunno how to do that
2014-11-11 16:36:07	jazoff	you just need to fill in the variables that the host would be using
2014-11-11 16:36:17	soehlert	oh right i dindt see your role profile stuff
2014-11-11 16:37:09	jazoff	http://puppetlabs.com/blog/debugging-hiera
2014-11-11 16:37:14	jazoff	shows puppet apply -e '$somevar = hiera(foo) notify { $somevar: }'
2014-11-11 16:37:18	jazoff	which they say may or may not work
2014-11-11 16:38:53	soehlert	haha wow, may or may not work..
2014-11-11 16:39:18	jazoff	"Depending on your setup, running this on the agent in question may work."
2014-11-11 16:39:37	soehlert	ok im seeing another issue
2014-11-11 16:39:50	soehlert	~/projects/puppet/puppet_configs/hieradata/development (configs) soehlert$ cat virtual/vmware.yaml

2014-11-11 16:41:07	jazoff	looks like puppet-sec is just out of data
2014-11-11 16:41:17	soehlert	out of data? or out of date?
2014-11-11 16:41:29	soehlert	and it shouldn't be

2014-11-11 16:42:57	jazoff	you moved the virtual thing up on the server?
2014-11-11 16:43:12	soehlert	i guess i musta messed that up. i didnt think so but musta been in the wrong window
2014-11-11 16:43:15	soehlert	oops
2014-11-11 16:43:17	jazoff	yeah, easy fix
2014-11-11 16:43:22	soehlert	that would explain why i had to do it again in git today
2014-11-11 16:44:01	jazoff	all better now
2014-11-11 16:44:06	soehlert	thanks
2014-11-11 16:45:34	soehlert	Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Hiera type mismatch: expected Array and got NilClass
2014-11-11 16:45:50	soehlert	oh nvm i think i can fix that
2014-11-11 16:46:05	jazoff	sounds like you have classes: with nothing after it
2014-11-11 16:48:09	soehlert	ok that's fixed, but it doesnt look like our idea will work
2014-11-11 16:48:16	jazoff	oh?
2014-11-11 16:48:42	soehlert	when i remove the vm::type from virtual/vmware.yaml it shows ca, but when I put that back in virtual/vmware.yaml, it shows vm
2014-11-11 16:49:24	jazoff	hmm, maybe the order needs to  be the other way
2014-11-11 16:49:31	jazoff	i forget how hiera works.. need to find the doc on it
2014-11-11 16:49:34	soehlert	the other way made more sense to me
2014-11-11 16:49:46	jazoff	is it first wins or last wins?
2014-11-11 16:50:19	soehlert	i thought it was first
2014-11-11 16:50:26	soehlert	that's why you do most specific first
2014-11-11 16:50:28	jazoff	In a normal (priority) lookup, Hiera will stop at the first data source with the requested data and return that value.
2014-11-11 16:50:33	jazoff	yeah, you're right
2014-11-11 16:50:43	jazoff	so, right the first time
2014-11-11 16:51:37	soehlert	yup and now it works as expected :)
2014-11-11 16:52:42	soehlert	at least it shows the right type anyway..
2014-11-11 22:35:51	soehlert	just a heads up, i need to take a travel day friday.
2014-11-13 14:35:30	soehlert	jschipp: nagios-monitor-sec is failing puppet runs
2014-11-13 14:38:31	soehlert	hmm and lowp cant connect to puppet-sec?
2014-11-13 15:49:43	jschipp	soehlert: kk, will check on it
2014-11-13 16:00:32	jschipp	ah, missing cert files for that machine, forgot about that one
2014-11-13 16:31:14	jschipp	I put in a CSR request
2014-11-18 18:52:04	<--	jschipp (jschipp@hidden-E95C13A8.ncsa.illinois.edu) has quit (Ping timeout)
2014-11-19 11:18:20	-->	jschipp (jschipp@hidden-E95C13A8.ncsa.illinois.edu) has joined #puppet
2014-11-21 11:11:27	soehlert	jazoff: can i get a lil puppet help?
2014-11-21 11:13:23	jazoff	sure
2014-11-21 11:16:01	soehlert	so icepick wants to start doing qualys scans on our public hosts
2014-11-21 11:16:08	jazoff	right, the ssh key thing
2014-11-21 11:16:15	soehlert	i have a class that will add the qualys user and adds the ssh key and all that
2014-11-21 11:16:21	soehlert	i created a fact looking for a public ip
2014-11-21 11:16:25	soehlert	and that all works
2014-11-21 11:16:32	soehlert	just not sure how to only deploy it to public hosts
2014-11-21 11:16:41	jazoff	ah.. can use hiera for that
2014-11-21 11:16:51	jazoff	like we did for vmware
2014-11-21 11:18:44	soehlert	ok that part makes sense. not sure if my manifest is set up in a good way for that though. 
2014-11-21 11:19:00	soehlert	i need the fact to go to all hosts to check, so that should probably be its own class right?
2014-11-21 11:20:11	jazoff	oh
2014-11-21 11:20:16	jazoff	yeah, kind of chicken and the egg there
2014-11-21 11:21:10	soehlert	i guess i could make the fact be the main qualys class and then do a conditional class on the public ip thing? it will take two runs
2014-11-21 11:23:00	jazoff	i guess
2014-11-21 11:24:52	soehlert	any other ideas? i cant think of another
2014-11-21 11:25:56	jazoff	either works
2014-11-21 11:26:16	jazoff	if you think we may want to do other public or private only classes in the future, might be worth it to setup hiera now
2014-11-21 11:26:18	soehlert	either being what?
2014-11-21 11:26:40	jazoff	either use hiera or have an if statement in the manifest
2014-11-21 11:26:43	soehlert	i set it up in hiera
2014-11-21 11:26:43	soehlert	but the fact is what decides if a host is public or private
2014-11-21 11:26:56	jazoff	ah right, you'll need to have that deployed on all hosts
2014-11-21 11:26:56	soehlert	so maybe i should just make the fact a separate module..
2014-11-21 11:27:09	jazoff	hmm
2014-11-21 11:27:18	jazoff	https://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/2.3/custom_facts.html#external-facts
2014-11-21 11:28:21	soehlert	we're not using plugin sync
2014-11-21 11:28:29	jazoff	ah, that was my next question
2014-11-21 11:28:34	jazoff	it's not on by default?
2014-11-21 11:28:44	soehlert	we're on 3.3 still i think
2014-11-21 11:28:51	jazoff	ah
2014-11-21 11:28:53	soehlert	upgrading puppet right now seemed like an awful idea
2014-11-21 11:29:14	soehlert	once i finish up the centos stuff..
2014-11-21 11:29:44	jazoff	yeah
2014-11-21 11:29:52	jazoff	we do have the facts class
2014-11-21 11:29:56	jazoff	which is kinda emtpy
2014-11-21 11:29:59	jazoff	maybe move the check in there?
2014-11-21 11:30:06	soehlert	oh really? 
2014-11-21 11:30:06	soehlert	ya i can do that.
2014-11-21 11:30:25	soehlert	then that shouyld be on every host and i'll just do qualys in the public.yaml
2014-11-21 11:31:00	soehlert	how do i tie the public_ip fact to public.yaml in hiera though?
2014-11-21 11:31:17	jazoff	ooooooh 
2014-11-21 11:31:25	jazoff	add two facts...
2014-11-21 11:31:38	jazoff	public_ip_address=141.142.x.y
2014-11-21 11:31:40	jazoff	public_ip=true
2014-11-21 11:31:48	jazoff	or whatever, then use public_ip for hiera
2014-11-21 11:32:20	soehlert	ok i can do that, but i dont understand how public_ip=true ties to the hiera file for public machines
2014-11-21 11:33:17	jazoff	we would have   - "%{::environment}/public_ip/%{::public_ip}"
2014-11-21 11:33:27	jazoff	and have true.yaml and false.yaml
2014-11-21 11:34:26	soehlert	ahhh ok perfect thanks!
2014-11-21 11:34:37	soehlert	im going to lunch, but i'll knock that out after
2014-11-21 11:35:17	jazoff	mm food, good idea
2014-11-21 13:43:57	soehlert	jazoff: do you know if i can do both facts in the same shell script?
2014-11-21 13:44:35	jazoff	yeah, i think you just echo two lines
2014-11-21 13:45:20	soehlert	ok i thought the fact was based on the file name wasn't sure
2014-11-21 14:07:53	soehlert	sweet: public_ip  true
2014-11-21 14:07:53	soehlert	public_ip_addr  141.142.148.13
2014-11-21 14:07:57	soehlert	from the dashboard
2014-11-21 14:09:47	jazoff	cool:)
2014-11-21 14:10:58	soehlert	and on an internal only one: public_ip false
2014-11-21 14:11:03	soehlert	seems to work thanks man
2014-11-21 14:12:23	soehlert	and the qualys works in conjunction
2014-11-21 14:12:53	jazoff	cool :)

2014-12-11 11:42:27	jschipp	just noticed this today, and I'm unable to find pam_krb5 in the configs repo
2014-12-11 11:44:27	jschipp	I was able to run puppet on this host yesterday and I don't see anything jumping out in git log
2014-12-11 11:45:33	soehlert	its being added by the packages module.
2014-12-11 11:45:52	soehlert	in hieradate/development/common.yaml
2014-12-11 11:45:52	soehlert	i moved it from kickstart to packages yesterday
2014-12-11 11:47:18	jschipp	ah, my repo wasn't up to date so I didn't see those changes
2014-12-11 11:47:40	soehlert	ya and i'd prefer to have it in packages so all machines get it. can you rmeove it from nagios?
2014-12-11 11:49:00	jschipp	done
2014-12-11 11:49:16	soehlert	perfect. sorry didnt know it was in there
2014-12-11 11:50:04	jschipp	no worries
2014-12-11 11:50:49	jschipp	are you seeing failures for cups-lib?

2014-12-11 11:51:04	soehlert	nope i havent seen that anywhere yet
2014-12-11 11:52:30	soehlert	errr wait
2014-12-11 11:52:30	soehlert	maybe i have..
2014-12-11 11:53:04	soehlert	yup hah. oops
2014-12-11 11:53:04	soehlert	all the dev servers.
2014-12-11 11:53:17	jschipp	kk
2014-12-11 11:54:06	soehlert	hmm im inclined to say we dont need gtk2 but im not sure
2014-12-11 11:55:52	soehlert	or just leave cups-libs
2014-12-11 11:55:52	soehlert	cups was really what i wanted gone..
2014-12-11 11:59:14	jschipp	i doubt we need gtk2, that's a library for GUI's
2014-12-11 12:04:01	jschipp	[root@nagios2-sec ~]# rpm -q --whatrequires gtk2
2014-12-11 12:04:02	jschipp	no package requires gtk2
2014-12-11 12:05:20	jschipp	none of my system are returning anything but tepid and supercell are for like the GUI firewall manager
2014-12-11 12:06:32	jschipp	wut? rhythmbox on supercell, lots of stuff installed there taht shouldn't be there lol
2014-12-11 12:14:55	soehlert	ya my concern is with the CAs mostly. i know terry loves his GUIs
2014-12-11 12:14:55	soehlert	but guis are installed on cebrerus and bwbh machiens too
2014-12-11 12:14:55	soehlert	and ya supercell was installed long ago by hand. that still needs converted doesn't it jazoff ?
2014-12-11 12:40:22	jschipp	aren't those all in the ncsa_production branch?
2014-12-11 12:40:46	jschipp	well I guess tepid may not be
2014-12-11 12:44:42	soehlert	they are, but i want this to remain the same throughout the branches. i dont want to do things differently in dev unless there are plans on moving it to the rest
2014-12-11 13:04:03	jazoff	soehlert: yeah, it does
2014-12-11 13:04:27	soehlert	what does?
2014-12-11 13:04:38	soehlert	oh nvm
2014-12-11 13:04:46	soehlert	got it
2014-12-11 13:04:46	soehlert	have you figured out the plan for that/
2014-12-11 13:32:48	jazoff	oh..
2014-12-11 13:33:09	jazoff	I wanted to hold off until the new splunk server was done, then finish puppetizing the splunk forwarder config
2014-12-11 13:33:15	jazoff	since that's the main thing that isn't in puppet
2014-12-11 13:35:22	soehlert	ahhh right thats what it was

2015-02-12 15:57:55	soehlert	jazoff: you around? having weird puppet issues and i just cant figure it out
2015-02-12 15:58:13	jazoff	hi
2015-02-12 15:58:49	soehlert	so there was an extraneous route on puppet-sec causing issues with nagios and just didnt need to be there since puppet-sec is dual homed
2015-02-12 15:58:49	soehlert	buuuut since removing it, internal only hosts cant do a run
2015-02-12 15:59:11	jazoff	because of how dns resolves
2015-02-12 15:59:14	soehlert	they get time out errors and doing tcpdumps on puppetsec shows puppet-sec not even sending anything back to that ip
2015-02-12 15:59:31	jazoff	there needs to be a puppet-sec.internal.ncsa.edu
2015-02-12 15:59:35	jazoff	that resolves to the 10. address
2015-02-12 15:59:52	jazoff	i think
2015-02-12 16:01:33	soehlert	so get that set up and piont all internal only hosts to that instead of the public ip?
2015-02-12 16:01:42	soehlert	so i'll have to reissue all certs for private hosts
2015-02-12 16:01:51	jazoff	er.. no...
2015-02-12 16:02:09	jazoff	actually, since we can just change the puppet.conf that would work too..
2015-02-12 16:02:39	jazoff	but puppet-sec.internal.ncsa.edu still doesnt exist
2015-02-12 16:02:42	jazoff	so need to get that setup
2015-02-12 16:03:38	jazoff	we setup the resolv module in puppet to put internal.ncsa.edu first if the box is on teh 10. network
2015-02-12 16:03:54	jazoff	so in theory you could just use 'puppet' on all hosts
2015-02-12 16:04:50	soehlert	ok well i put in a request for that A record
2015-02-12 16:05:02	soehlert	ahhh forgot about the resolv module
2015-02-12 16:07:27	jazoff	you can see if you connect directly from an internal box to the 10. address of puppet-sec it works ok
2015-02-12 16:07:38	soehlert	yes i did see that
2015-02-12 16:08:01	jazoff	and if you run tcpdump on puppet-sec and look at both eth interfaces you will see why the other way doesnt work
2015-02-12 16:08:06	jazoff	dog walk time :)
2015-02-12 16:08:18	soehlert	ya i already noticed that, but i didnt know the fix. 
2015-02-12 16:15:15	jazoff	brbrrrrrr cold
2015-02-12 16:15:23	soehlert	haha how cold?
2015-02-12 16:16:14	jazoff	42 but really windy
2015-02-12 16:16:24	jazoff	was 60 yesterday :)
2015-02-12 16:16:58	soehlert	ughh this is why I'm ready for next week. Get some of that San Fran weather. Its 19 here
2015-02-12 16:17:48	jazoff	:)
2015-02-12 16:18:14	jazoff	SF was funny when i was there in OCT.. everyone walking around in jackets and scarves and I was in shorts and a t-shirt
2015-02-12 16:18:31	jazoff	though I mentioned that to my friend and he said its because the temprature can really vary from one side to the other
2015-02-12 16:20:03	soehlert	Hah. I think it's funny how people adapt. My sister obviously grew up with me by Chi. Then after college moved to Miami and now Houston. When I was in Hou last (Oct) it was low 60s. I was in shorts and a tshirt and she was wearing a full blown coat
2015-02-12 16:20:27	jazoff	ever been to florida?
2015-02-12 16:20:36	jazoff	they think 65 is the end of the world
2015-02-12 16:20:40	soehlert	yup i was in miami a few times and then a bunch when i was little
2015-02-12 16:20:52	soehlert	haha ya i saw parkas and scarves when it was in the upper 50s there once.
2015-02-12 16:20:54	jazoff	ah well more old people florida
2015-02-12 16:21:01	soehlert	i went surfing that day no shirt and boardshorts
2015-02-13 13:37:20	soehlert	jazoff: puppet-sec has an internal hostname and it still fails.
2015-02-13 13:50:05	jazoff	what hostname is in the puppet.conf file?
2015-02-13 13:50:25	jazoff	puppet-sec or the full non-public hostname?
2015-02-13 13:55:11	soehlert	puppet-sec.ncsa.illinois.edu
2015-02-13 14:01:29	jazoff	change to just puppet-sec
2015-02-13 14:01:45	jazoff	though, just realized we may run into cert problems
2015-02-13 14:01:49	jazoff	but try that
2015-02-13 14:01:57	soehlert	ya thats what i was trying to say yeseterday
2015-02-13 14:02:01	jazoff	that'll fix the tcp problem
2015-02-13 14:02:05	jazoff	im not sure if it will care
2015-02-13 14:02:14	jazoff	since it trusts the cert 
2015-02-13 14:18:07	soehlert	it does seem we've avoided cert issues
2015-02-13 14:23:27	jazoff	:)
2015-02-13 14:23:41	soehlert	now to just adjust that on all internal only hosts...

2015-02-27 15:46:20	jschipp	is there a way to notify an exec type in a difference class?
2015-02-27 15:48:24	soehlert	hmmm not sure. could try it, would probably be something like this
2015-02-27 15:48:45	soehlert	notify => Exec["classname::exec"]
2015-02-27 15:54:51	jschipp	can't find it then, thinking I may have inherit the class, then may work
2015-02-27 15:55:17	soehlert	ya that might do it. makes sense to me anyways
2015-02-27 15:56:21	jazoff	hmm.. i dont hink you need to qualify it
2015-02-27 15:57:09	jazoff	notify => Exec["nameofexec"] should be fine
2015-02-27 15:57:57	soehlert	i assume you mean after you've inherit it?
2015-02-27 15:59:09	jazoff	i mean, you can do it from a completely different file
2015-02-27 15:59:47	soehlert	but couldnt you have multiple execs with the same name then?
2015-02-27 16:00:39	jazoff	correct
2015-02-27 16:00:44	jazoff	you can't have any resouces with the same name
2015-02-27 16:01:18	soehlert	in the same file. but say in squid I could have an exec called copy and i could have one called copy in ssh right?
2015-02-27 16:01:25	soehlert	or is that what you mean you cant double up on?
2015-02-27 16:01:32	jazoff	nope
2015-02-27 16:01:42	jazoff	or yes, you can't have two Exec["copy"]
2015-02-27 16:02:11	soehlert	no i mean like this from the squid/manifests/init.pp
2015-02-27 16:02:24	soehlert	exec{"reload":
2015-02-27 16:02:32	soehlert	so no other module can now use an exec named reload?
2015-02-27 16:03:53	jazoff	right
2015-02-27 16:04:02	soehlert	ahhh ok
2015-02-27 16:04:06	jazoff	you should use exec {"reload-squid" or such
2015-02-27 16:04:15	soehlert	i should probably rename it squid reload or something then
2015-02-27 17:00:25	jschipp	thanks
